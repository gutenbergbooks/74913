  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The great war will leave more than a deep mark
on our country; when it is over, there will be a
different England, a different Scotland, a different
Ireland. Grown-up people will always remember vividly
the old, happy, peaceful, confiding England, as she was
before her placid contentment was rudely shattered in
a night.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what of the children? There are thousands and
thousands of little children who will look back all their
lives to this war as their first important recollection, the
first impact on their minds of the great world of realities
lying outside all childish things. It will not be possible
to keep from them the knowledge of many horrors and
savage brutalities, and it is therefore the more necessary
that there should be shown to them as soon as possible
the other and glorious side of the shield. It is the more
necessary that for our children, through the long years
that lie before them, the memory of the Great War should
be touched to noble issues—that it should be, first and
foremost, a memory of deeds as gallant as any that have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>ever been inscribed in Christendom’s long roll of
honour.</p>

<p class='c011'>There can hardly be one British child whose little
world of personal affections and interests has not been
roughly disturbed by the war. Many have seen their
fathers and brothers going off to fight, and to many those
dear fathers and brothers will never come back. Even
the children who have no kindred in the Navy or Army
have friends who have gone out. In every village familiar
faces are missed, and some will never be seen again. In
every town, great and small, it is the same—this new and
disturbing sense of personal loss.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this book the writer has endeavoured to show by
force of contrast that savagery and brutality are not of
the essence of war. The Happy Warrior is to be found
in all ranks and in all armies, and it is an inspiring thought
that, for every brave deed the record of which has leapt
to light, there must be ten others of which the stirring
story will never be known.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every intelligent child must have gradually become
aware that this great war illustrates the enormously increased
havoc that may now be wrought by various
scientific engines of destruction. But it is the object of
the writer to demonstrate that the personal valour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>officers and men remains the ultimately decisive factor.
Man can never devise a more marvellous war machine
than himself. All through the ages we see that battles
are really won, not by improvements in weapons of precision,
but by the unquenchable spirit of the individual
soldiers and sailors who wield them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The writer has, wherever possible, linked on each
tale of heroism to one like it in the annals of past wars.
This serves to bring out what is perhaps the most splendid
lesson of the present gigantic struggle, namely that the
soldiers and sailors of the present day are indeed the
worthy successors of the heroes of the past.</p>

<p class='c011'>The writer has also drawn on the treasures of the older
English poetry with which some modern children are not
too well acquainted. It is her experience that children
instinctively respond to the best in literature, and also
that lines which to their elders may seem hackneyed
keep all their old power to thrill and uplift the young
imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, Belgium and France are rich in historic
and literary associations, and the writer has ventured
to refer to books such as <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite>, <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>,
and <cite>Villette</cite>, which children ought to know about now,
and to read when they are older.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>As to the sources from which the deeds of valour
and of chivalry recounted are taken, they range from
the brilliant, highly literate accounts written by war
correspondents to extracts taken from the wonderfully
vivid and picturesque narratives contained in letters
written home to mothers and wives by soldiers and sailors
just after the actions described.</p>

<p class='c011'>To all these unknown helpers to whom the best part
of her book is due, the writer tenders her grateful thanks.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now tell us what ’twas all about,”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Young Peterkin, he cries.</div>
      <div class='line'>And little Wilhelmine looks up</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With wonder-waiting eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Now tell us all about the war,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what they fought each other for?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Like the children in Mr. Southey’s poem, you will
want to know first of all why we joined in with
France and Russia in the great war against
Germany and Austria. Well, the answer in a word is—Belgium.</p>

<p class='c013'>Supposing you had solemnly promised to protect a
little kitten and afterwards a big dog came and attacked
the kitten, would you not keep your promise, and do all
you could to help the kitten? Of course you would.
Belgium was the kitten, and Germany was the big dog.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>We had faithfully promised to protect the little country
of Belgium, and the terrible thing is that Germany had
promised too, but she broke her promise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Germany wanted to get into France.</p>

<p class='c013'>If you look at the map, you will see that the Germans
might have tried to go straight in without touching
Belgium. Only then they would have had to break
through a very strong line of forts which the French had
built to defend their country. The Germans did not
feel sure of doing this, and they said to themselves,
“The longest way round is the shortest way in.” That
meant going through Belgium.</p>

<p class='c013'>You have probably heard grown-up people, when
discussing this great war, mention “a scrap of paper.”
You may even have wondered what a scrap of paper could
have to do with the war. I will tell you. On the dread
day when our mighty country threw down the gauntlet,
the German statesman who had worked hard to keep
England out of Germany’s quarrel with France and
Russia exclaimed, “You are going to war for a scrap
of paper!” He spoke truly, but on that scrap of paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>or parchment was written the solemn promise of both
England and Germany to be like big brothers to Belgium
and protect her from being bullied.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first the Germans were very nice to Belgium.
They said, “Only let us come through your country,
and when we have conquered France we will give you
a splendid reward!” But France also had promised
to be a big brother to Belgium, and so Belgium said
“No!”</p>

<p class='c013'>England also said “No!” England said to Germany,
“If you touch our little friend Belgium, we will fight
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So that is why the British Empire went to war with
Germany. If we had chosen the easy way of breaking
our promise by simply doing nothing, by standing out
and merely looking on at the awful struggle, would we
now be proud of being English? I think not.</p>

<p class='c013'>Germany did more than break her promise to protect
Belgium. When she found that the brave little
country was gamely going to fight, she sent her great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>armies, hundreds of thousands of trained soldiers with
fleets of aeroplanes and terrible big guns, whose shells,
as they are now called, could kill people miles away.
She thought she would easily be able to march through
Belgium right into France, and she fully expected to
capture the city of Paris—all in one month!</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, Germany made the worst mistake that can
be made in war—the mistake of despising her enemies.
She despised the power of the French armies, and she
also very much despised the British Army. She had a
good deal of respect for the British Navy because it is
big, but because the British Army was small she thought
it did not matter. Well, she was taught a richly-deserved
lesson by Sir John French and his splendid troops, of
whose gallant deeds you will read in this book.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of all, Germany despised the army of poor
little Belgium. And yet the game little kitten, though
suffering terribly herself, contrived to inflict some severe
scratches on the big German dog. She actually held
him up for quite a long time, to his great surprise and
rage, and that delay was of the utmost benefit both to
France and to England. It enabled them to make their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>final preparations for serious fighting, and it gave us
time to send our Army across the Channel to join up
with the French forces.</p>

<p class='c013'>Notice, also, that it would have been very useful to
France to send her armies through Belgium to attack
Germany. What prevented her? Just “a scrap of
paper,” just her pledge and promise. She could not
break her word, because it would not have been playing
fair, it would have been taking a mean advantage—the
same mean advantage that Germany did not hesitate to
take.</p>

<p class='c011'>But you may ask, “Why did not the French at least
send plenty of soldiers to defend Belgium?” The
answer is that they did offer to send more than 200,000
men. But Belgium refused. She believed that Germany
would keep her written promise. “Can the Kaiser put
his name to a lie?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Terribly did Belgium suffer for her trust in German
honour. But once she saw her trust was betrayed, her
little army fought with splendid courage, thousands of
Germans were killed in the first battles, and thanks to
the splendid defence put up by the forts of a Belgian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>town called Liège, she delayed the vast, oncoming German
hosts till Britain and France were ready to take them on.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c015'>I am sure all of you are now familiar with the
glorious name of Liège, but you may not know so well
that of the hero whose name is now linked for ever with
that of Liège—I mean General Leman, who conducted
the splendid defence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The flower of the German Army was hurled against
the city and the forts and thirty thousand Belgians
fought like lions repulsing the enemy. Great deeds of
individual valour were done, and a special interest attaches
to them as they were the first gallant deeds of this
Great War.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is the story of a young soldier whose name is
inscribed for ever on the Belgian roll of honour.</p>

<p class='c011'>I must tell you that waterways, almost always very
beautiful and picturesque waterways, play a great part
in the life of Belgium, and much fierce fighting has gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>on, as we shall see, on the banks of rivers, canals, and
streams. In order to cut off the enemy, it became all
important to the Belgians to cross a canal, but the bridge
was up, and the mechanism was on the side held by the
Germans.</p>

<p class='c011'>A young soldier, named Tresignies, facing certain
death, dived into the stream, and swam across under
the German fire. He leapt up the bank of the stream,
got hold of the pulley, and so lowered the bridge; but
as it fell in place, he himself fell dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The days went on, and still Liège held out amid
terrible scenes of bloodshed and heroism. Outside the
forts the Belgians were not idle. Fiercely they fought
the enemy, and the Germans on their side were full of
pluck and of determination to conquer or die.</p>

<p class='c013'>A fort is always built on the top of a hill or huge
mound. Up the slopes of each fort the Germans advanced
again and again, under a withering fire, and it was said
that eight hundred men were killed within an half mile
square. If valour could have taken the forts during
those early days of the siege, Liège would have fallen.
According to an eye-witness who has seen much of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>actual fighting during the war, the enemy never fought
so well as at Liège. But the enemy had a foe worthy
of its steel.</p>

<p class='c013'>An exciting and heartening incident of the fighting
round Liège was the capture by a brave Belgian boy of
a German general.</p>

<p class='c013'>A day may come when some of you British boys and
girls will understand why grown-up people smile when
they note that this boy’s name is Jean Jacques Rousseau.
For Jean Jacques Rousseau was also the name of one who,
if a great thinker and writer, was not, in a physical sense,
a brave man; indeed, so vivid was the original Jean Jacques
Rousseau’s wonderful imagination, and so poor his courage,
that he would probably have fainted with fright had
he been vouchsafed a vision of his namesake’s gallant and
daring deed!</p>

<p class='c013'>The brave Jean Jacques Rousseau is only nineteen, yet
he had already been a soldier for three years when at
Zelk, close to Liège, he succeeded in making this officer
of high rank his prisoner. The German general seems to
have put up very little fight; tamely he surrendered to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>captor a satchel containing not only papers, but six thousand
pounds in notes and gold! Jean Jacques handed
over the money to the Red Cross, for its noble work of
tending the wounded, but he was allowed to keep the
satchel, and the General’s silver helmet.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Germans found they could not take
Liège by what is called a frontal attack—that is by
an attack from the front—they brought up their
huge siege guns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now here I must stop to tell you about these guns.
They were the first surprise of the War, for their construction
was kept a profound secret by Germany, who with
their help believed herself invincible! It is suspected
by some people that these new siege guns were to be kept
hidden till the enemy wished to strike terror into the
defenders of the huge forts which guard Paris. If that
be so, then the gallant defence put up by Liège forced
the German generals to alter their plan, for as soon as they
found they could not take the Belgian stronghold by
assault, they dragged up seven huge guns—it takes thirty-five
pairs of horses to drag one along—and began battering
the Liège forts to pieces!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Soon the Fort of Loncin, where the brave General
Leman had his headquarters, was entirely isolated. Each
man, however, went on with his work calmly and courageously,
and that even when the bombardment was so terrible
that many were made—we must hope only temporarily—stone
deaf.</p>

<p class='c013'>One afternoon, just as General Leman and his staff
were hastily drinking a cup of tea, a terrific explosion
shook the whole fort, and a moment later its concrete walls
collapsed in a cloud of flame and dust. Many were killed
outright; those who survived had the anguish of seeing
the enemy rush in.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the midst of a scene of frightful horror and confusion
the Germans sought with frantic eagerness for General
Leman. Soon they found him, but at first they thought
he was dead. He was, however, breathing, and so, still
unconscious, he was placed on a stretcher and taken out
of the ruins of the fort he had defended so gloriously.</p>

<p class='c013'>There then occurred a fine little incident, and one to
the credit of the enemy. At the end of a gallery of which
the sides were still standing, were gathered together all
that was left of the garrison. Black with powder, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>faces streaked with blood, their clothes in ribbons, their
hands clasping shattered rifles, the heroic little group,
some twenty-five men, still stood to resist. Touched by
such splendid courage, the Germans, instead of attacking,
flung aside their weapons and ran to the help of the brave
Belgian soldiers. Of the five hundred men who formed
the garrison of Fort Loncin three hundred and fifty were
killed and more than a hundred were seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile General Leman had recovered consciousness.
He had sworn never to be taken alive, but Fate
had proved too strong for him! He was accordingly
brought before General von Emmich, the Commander
of the German forces. Sadly the Defender of Liège
tendered his sword; but the German general handed it
back to him, and, bowing courteously, congratulated
General Leman very warmly on the splendid way in
which he had conducted the defence.</p>

<p class='c013'>This example of German magnanimity recalls a French
incident of the kind which happened rather more than
a hundred years ago. Lord Cochrane, commanding his
little British brig, the Speedy, was captured by the huge
Desaix. Admiral Linois, who lives in history as the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of Napoleon’s naval commanders, refused, when Cochrane
had to surrender, to take his sword. “I cannot,” he cried,
“take the sword of a man so brave that he has been doing
the impossible for twelve hours!” This was an allusion
to the fact that though three huge French battleships
had all attacked the Speedy together, her commander,
by brilliant seamanship, had actually managed to elude
capture for a whole day.</p>

<p class='c013'>General Leman, on being made prisoner, sent a very
touching letter to the King of the Belgians:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your Majesty will learn with grief that Fort Loncin
was blown up yesterday at 5.20 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, the greater part of
the garrison being buried under the ruins.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I did not lose my life in that catastrophe is
due to my escort, who drew me from a stronghold whilst
I was being suffocated by gas from the exploded powder.
I was conveyed to a trench, where I fell. A German
captain gave me drink, and I was made prisoner and
taken to Liège.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In honour of our arms I have surrendered neither
the fortress nor the forts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deign pardon, Sire. In Germany, where I am proceeding,
my thoughts will be, as they always have been,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of Belgium and the King. I would willingly have given
my life the better to serve them, but death was not granted
to me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lieutenant-General <span class='sc'>Leman</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was a happy and a graceful act on the part of the
French Government to bestow the Legion of Honour on
the town of Liège, which, as was well said in the decree
setting forth the honour, “was called upon to bear the
first brunt of the German troops, and kept the invading
army in check in a struggle which was as unequal as it
was heroic.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Every soldier worthy of the name not only respects,
but heartily admires, a gallant, magnanimous foe. Had
there been even a few German commanders like General
von Emmich, there would not now rest, as there will
do till the Day of Judgment, an indelible stain on Germany’s
name.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is awful to have to put on record that after the fall
of Liège the enemy, maddened by the unexpected resistance,
took a fearful vengeance on poor little Belgium.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they marched through the lovely, peaceful villages,
and charming, storied towns, which all other invaders had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>spared even in the so-called dark ages, the Germans
burnt, blew up, and destroyed far and wide, killing even
women and children in their ruthlessness. Yet even so,
these unarmed Belgians performed wonderful deeds of
valour.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the enemy approached Heristal, the Belgian
Woolwich, where is the National Arms Factory, the town
was defended against the German attack by the women, for
all the men were already away fighting.</p>

<p class='c011'>These wives and mothers swore that the enemy should
never take the factory. They armed themselves with
revolvers and other weapons, and actually repulsed several
charges of the Uhlans. When their ammunition was
exhausted, they barricaded themselves in various houses
and poured boiling water on the Germans. Children
and old men shared in the defence, and for two days the
Belgian colours still floated over the factory buildings.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is scarcely a village, and there is no town, in
Belgium which has not some glorious page of history
to its credit, and some precious survival of the Middle
Ages in the shape of a noble old church or town hall.
Only the glorious pages of history now remain. But these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>have been added to, for as a brave Frenchwoman once
finely phrased it, “Le plomb ne tue pas l’idée,”
which may be freely translated, “Bullets can only kill
the body.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The storied monuments alas! which belonged not only
to generous little Belgium, but to the whole world, are
gone. Battered, shattered, in many cases razed to the
ground, by German lead, which, though powerless to
kill the mind, has been able to destroy the sanctified beauty
which the genius of artists and of saints had created with
such happy labour and prayers.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a pathetic and even an awesome thing to have to
say of any place—even of a tiny village—“it was, and is
no longer.” That, unhappily, is what we now have to
say of the venerable and beautiful town of Louvain—the
Oxford of Belgium. Spared by innumerable armies, by
the fighting men of a thousand years, it fell victim to one
stupid barbarian, who, I suppose, still imagines himself
to be an officer and a gentleman. His name is given as
Manteuffel, and it is a curious irony of fate that the
destroyer of one of the oldest homes of learning in Europe
should bear a name honoured by all classical scholars.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>This German commander, angered by a report, which
seems to have been quite false, that some of the inhabitants
of the town had fired when they saw their dread enemy
approaching, ordered his soldiers to set fire, deliberately
and systematically, to the houses and public buildings of
a town which, to all lovers of the beautiful and to every
scholar in the old and the new world, had become a
shrine, a place of joyful pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Till this summer there actually remained at Louvain
a fragment of what had once been Cæsar’s Castle, and this
survival of Roman days was of special interest to English
people, for Edward III and his queen lived in the Castle
for a winter. That great Emperor, Charles V, and his
sister also, were scholars at Louvain, their teacher there
being a priest who afterwards became Pope Adrian VI.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heroic deeds were performed by some of the citizens
of Louvain. Take the case of Dr. Noyons, who happened
at the time to be Principal of the Medical Faculty of the
University. On the very day the German Army approached
the town, he suddenly learned that a hundred
wounded were to be brought in. Beds were hurriedly
got ready, and Dr. Noyons and his wife, as well as a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>staff, were in attendance. This was at mid-day, and the
wounded kept arriving all the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>At seven o’clock the firing of the town began! By
eight o’clock the famous library was in flames!</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Noyons’ own house, though it contained a number
of wounded and had the Red Cross flag on the door,
was now set on fire. But all night long the professor
and his wife went on attending on the wounded, and
when, the next morning, they were informed they must
leave the town, in order that it might be razed to the
ground by big guns, this noble-hearted couple at once
decided to remain with those of the wounded (many
of them Germans) who were too much injured to be
moved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Helped by a few trusted assistants, they carried their
unhappy patients into the cellars of the hospital, and then
they remained waiting for two days for a bombardment
which fortunately never came. At the end of that
time, this brave steadfast pair—a hero and heroine
of a rare and splendid type—brought the wounded
up again to the wards, and calmly continued to look
after them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Quite as awful as the fate of Louvain was that of the
pretty town of Termonde. But there also splendid deeds
of heroism were performed by quite simple folk.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four times early in the War was unhappy Termonde
bombarded, and twice it was deliberately set ablaze.
But there were wounded there all through, and the Burgomaster
and his two daughters never left the town. The
two girls—the elder seventeen, and her sister a year
younger—stayed at their posts as voluntary nurses, brave
and fearless, thinking of nothing but their duty to the
wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>The name of Termonde will now be for ever associated
with the wicked and brutal conduct of the German Army.
But before this last invasion of Belgium, Termonde was
famed as having been the scene of all sorts of romantic
incidents. Louis XIV, the stateliest of the great French
kings, was very nearly drowned there, for the country
round the town, like that of Holland, can be flooded at
will. When the Sun King (as Louis XIV was nicknamed)
was told that Marlborough was about to besiege
Termonde, he observed: “He will have to bring an
army of ducks to take it!” But Marlborough had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>good luck to be there at a time of terrible drought,
and so the brave garrison had to surrender.</p>

<p class='c013'>Malines, or Mechlin as we ought to call it, was also the
scene of one of the fiercest fights, and suffered greatly
from the enemy. The beautiful little town was splendidly
defended by the brave Belgians, but after two days’ battle
they had to retire. Mechlin is famous, not only for its
exquisite lace, but also for its peal of bells, and this,
grievous to say, was destroyed by a German shell.
Robert Browning, in a poem which I expect many of
you know by heart, “How they brought the good news
from Ghent to Aix,” wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And from Mechlin church steeple we heard the half chime.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But, tragic as was the fate of Mechlin, its most
treasured relic was saved! This, amusing to relate, is
a curious doll which bears the odd name of Op-Signoorke.
This doll is said to have been modelled from a dwarf who
was the official jester of a famous Antwerp club in the
sixteenth century. In those days, every king and many a
great noble had his dwarf, a kind of human toy who
often played a considerable part in the life of his master.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The story goes that at a time when there was a great
deal of friendly rivalry between the Flemish towns,
Mechlin boasted of a wonderful dwarf jester who could
out-talk and outwit any of his rivals. One of the Antwerp
Guilds was much annoyed at this, and when the next
meeting took place, it suddenly produced a new dwarf
jester named Klaasken, who beat the Mechlin dwarf at
his own game!</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon afterwards Klaasken died, and when the next
contest was held the good folk of Antwerp produced a
wonderful model of him, beautifully carved and splendidly
dressed. The Mechlin people, incensed at this insult to
their live dwarf, carried him off one dark night, when
the doll was left unguarded. Op-Signoorke, as he
was then re-christened, remained at Mechlin, and ever
since, on the occasion of the annual Kermesse, he is hung
out for all to see from a window of the town hall. Now
when it was known that the Germans were close to the
town, a wise alderman put Op-Signoorke in a bomb-proof
shelter, where he will repose till poor Belgium comes into
her own again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shakespeare’s line in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, “Let slip the dogs
of war,” has a practical meaning in this war. Both the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>French and the German armies are accompanied to the
front by war dogs; <i><span lang="fr">les chiens militaires</span></i> and <i><span lang="de">die Kriegshunde</span></i>,
as they are respectively called, are trained to act as scouts,
carry despatches, and they even help, as we shall see later
on, to succour the wounded. In Belgium dogs do much
of the work performed in other countries by horses, and
during some of the more recent fights the smaller pieces
of artillery were actually harnessed to dog teams.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now we must leave brave Belgium for a while,
though later in this book you will hear of many gallant
deeds and romantic happenings, as well as much that
is piteous and terrible, concerning that country which
for hundreds of years has been called “The Cockpit of
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But there is much, even as I write, that goes to show
that Belgium’s day of ordeal is drawing to a close, and to
her we may say that as long as Britain, France, and Russia
endure:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>“There’s not a breathing of the common wind</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>After the War broke out, a wise man declared
that every British child ought to say this grace
before meat:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank God for my good dinner and for the British
Navy.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Perhaps you will wonder why he put the dinner and
the Navy together in this way. It is because British
children during the war owed their dinners, and all their
other meals also, to the Navy. This may sound strange,
but it is perfectly true. The Navy guarded the thousands
of merchant ships which bring us food and other things
from abroad.</p>

<p class='c011'>We do not grow nearly enough corn at home to
feed everybody, so we have to buy from Canada,
America, and other countries. The German Navy
would have liked to capture the ships which brought
us this corn, but owing to the British Navy it could
not do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>But that is not all that the British Navy did.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have told you how the Germans invaded Belgium
and there were terrible fighting and ravaging, in which not
only soldiers but also women and children were killed.
Well, the Germans were even more angry with Britain
than with Belgium. They would have dearly liked
to send over hundreds of thousands of soldiers in
big ships to land on the east coast of England, perhaps
at Cromer, or Hunstanton, or Felixstowe, or other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>places where children often go for their summer
holidays.</p>

<p class='c013'>In our next chapter you will hear of how Napoleon
waited impatiently at Boulogne in the hope of swooping
down on England. There is a tradition in Dorsetshire
that he did come secretly just to see what stretch
of shore on that lonely coast would be most suitable
for a landing of troops. This tradition or old belief is
embodied in a wonderful short story by Mr. Thomas
Hardy.</p>

<p class='c013'>What would the German soldiers have done to us if
they had landed? I am afraid they would have treated
us even worse than they treated Belgium. The whole
countryside would have been laid waste with fire and
sword, and thousands of innocent people might have been
killed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Be thankful that England was not invaded like that.
Be thankful that, while the poor Belgians were being
bullied and beaten down, we could all sleep safely in our
beds.</p>

<p class='c011'>You know why that was. We owed our safety entirely
to the strong arm of our Navy. All round our shores,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>day and night, our gallant tars were watching, watching.
And the ships full of German soldiers could not think of
coming. Our Navy would have blown them to pieces if
they had tried.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, it was a terribly anxious time for Admiral Sir
John Jellicoe and the brave officers and men under him.
Many accidents can happen at sea which could not happen
on land, and the whole Fleet knew well that the Germans
might make a dash for it, and perhaps land a small force
of men after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>The portraits of Sir John Jellicoe show him as
a man with a very strong face and a determined mouth
and chin, but the expression of his eyes is full of
kindness.</p>

<p class='c011'>He earned his great position by sheer hard work.
When he was a naval cadet, he took three firsts, and
won a prize of £80 as well at the Royal Naval College.
Afterwards, he studied naval guns and the art of firing
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Admiral Jellicoe is one of the officers of the Royal
Navy who have received the Board of Trade medal for
gallantry in saving life at sea. He himself, too, has been
saved from drowning at sea, for he was in command of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the Victoria which was rammed by the Camperdown
twenty-one years ago; in fact, he was one of the very few
who were saved in that terrible disaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quite early in the war, a bluejacket of H.M.S. Zealandia,
the fine battleship which was given to the Mother
Country by the great Dominion of New Zealand, wrote
a poem called “The Walls of Jellicoe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He sent it to his aunt, and she, aunt-like, was so
pleased with it that she sent it to a paper! There I
read it, and I thought it so good and so true that I
cut it out. Here are the verses I like best. But I like

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This sailor poet expresses in his homely way the
exact truth. Admiral Jellicoe had indeed a good many
things to think about; and while he was keeping his ceaseless
watch in the North Sea he had the grief of hearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>that his old father, a seaman like himself, had died in the
Isle of Wight. He could not be at his father’s death-bed;
he could not follow his father’s coffin to the burial. His
place was at the post of duty and of danger.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have said that in the first months of the war the
German Fleet would not come out from under the shelter
of the German fortress guns. But you must not think
that its commander, Admiral von Ingemohl, a very gallant
seaman, was content to do nothing. He counted on taking
some of our ships by surprise, and so making matters more
equal before having a regular big battle. But as we shall
see, he found that Admiral Jellicoe could play at that
game too.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c015'>The Germans may be said to have drawn first blood
at sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very early in the war, in fact on the very day that most
people knew our country was at war, on August 5, 1914,
H.M.S. Amphion, while searching for the mine-layer
Königin Luise, was blown up, whether by a mine or a
torpedo will probably never be known.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Here I must explain that a mine at sea is a large rounded
metal box full of stuff that blows up when a ship bumps
against it. These mines are laid a little under the surface
of the water. As for a torpedo, it is a long thing shaped
like a fish, with a motor in its tail. It is also loaded
with stuff to blow up, and it can be fired at an
enemy’s ship from a submarine or from a torpedo
boat. The motor in its tail makes it travel very fast
under water, and if it hits a ship it is almost certain to
destroy her.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Amphion bumped on a mine, or was hit by
a torpedo, a sheet of flame enveloped the bridge and
rendered her commander, Captain Fox, insensible. Soon
he recovered consciousness and he ran instantly to the
engine-room to stop the engines. But the good ship’s
back was broken, and she was already settling down by
the bows. At once efforts were made to place the wounded
in safety, but by the time some destroyers came up the
Amphion had to be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c011'>The crew lined up in perfect discipline, everything was
done without any confusion, and twenty minutes after
the blow was first struck, all the men and most of the
officers had left the ship. It was well they did so, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>three minutes afterwards came another explosion, blowing
up the whole forepart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Discipline is one of the finest words in our language,
and it is one we share with our French Allies, for although
the word is pronounced a little differently in French, it is
written exactly the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>What is discipline? Discipline is composed of two
human qualities which, if they appear to have very little
to do with one another, are yet often allied. These
qualities are obedience and courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The finest example of discipline in the history of the
British Navy is the story of the sinking of the Birkenhead.
She was a troopship and she struck on a rock. Instantly,
the boats were lowered and filled with the women and
children. Then, the soldiers and marines were formed
up on deck, and they faced their death in perfect order
as if on parade while the ship slowly sank.</p>

<p class='c011'>The then King of Prussia, Frederick IV, was so impressed
by the behaviour of the doomed crew on the
Birkenhead that he caused this story of “iron discipline
and perfect duty” to be read aloud at the head of every
regiment in his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Mr. Rudyard Kipling has referred to the cool courage
of the marines, or “Jollies” as they are called, in a famous
poem:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with the firing all about,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is none so bad when you’ve cover to ’and, and leave and liking to shout,</div>
      <div class='line'>But to stand stock still to the Birken’ead drill is a dam tough bullet to chew;</div>
      <div class='line'>An’ they done it, the Jollies, ’er Majesty’s Jollies, soldier and sailor, too!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But to return to the Amphion. The story I like
best is one that was told in a bluejacket’s letter to
his parents:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were all stunned on the upper deck, surrounded
with flame and smoke. Then we saw our captain come.
His arms were burnt, and his hair; he spoke very nice.
‘Cheer up, men, and be brave; we shall all get saved.’
Of course that cheered up everyone. No excitement at
all. The biggest part of us stripped off to swim for it, but
no one left that ship until the captain gave the order to go,
and, thank God, we were all saved that was alive.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>You notice that gallant Captain Fox struck first a noble
note, “Be brave!” he cried; and then, as an afterthought,
“We shall all get saved.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A day or two later it was shown that the British Navy
knows how to honour a brave foe. Four members of
the crew of the Amphion and four of the German mine-layer’s
crew died in hospital at Harwich. Each son of the
sea, Briton and German, was provided with the same kind
of coffin, and the same service was performed for each of
the eight separately. The funerals were most reverently
conducted, each coffin being hoisted on the shoulders
of seamen. The dead Britons had a Union Jack for pall,
the Germans the ensign of their Fatherland. They were
all lowered into one grave. Volleys were fired, and the
Last Post sounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>To show you the kind of risk our sailors run without
a thought of self, hearken to the amazing adventures of
Stationmaster Stapleton, of Hykeham, who is a Naval
Reserve man. He received his call, joined his ship, the
Amphion, found himself in action, was sunk, and was rescued—all
within forty-eight hours of leaving his little
wayside station!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>III</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It was on August 28 that Sir John Jellicoe first tried
his hand at the surprise game of the Germans. It was
a brilliant success.</p>

<p class='c013'>Out of the morning mist our ships crept and caught
a German cruiser squadron lying in supposed safety under
the guns of Heligoland. We sank the German protected
cruiser Mainz and another cruiser of the same class, while
a third cruiser “disappeared” in the mist, heavily on
fire, and in a sinking condition. We also badly damaged
some smaller craft, while our own ships got off very lightly.
But we had to mourn the loss of sixty-nine men killed and
wounded, including Lieut.-Commander Nigel Barttelot
and Lieut. Eric Westmacott among the killed.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the ships which took part in this action had the
words “Heligoland, August 28, 1914,” painted in gold
letters in a conspicuous place aboard them. But special
honour was paid to the light cruiser Arethusa.</p>

<p class='c011'>This gallant little ship showed herself worthy of her
name, which is one of the most glorious in the Navy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>In recognition of the notable part she played in the
fight, the Admiralty ordered the famous old song of “The
Saucy Arethusa” to be engraved upon a brass plate and
set up in a prominent place on board the ship. The first
verse runs:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come all ye sailors bold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose hearts are cast in honour’s mould,</div>
      <div class='line'>While English glory I unfold,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Huzza for the Arethusa!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Her men are staunch</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To their favourite launch,</div>
      <div class='line'>And when the foe shall meet our fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sooner than strike we’ll all expire</div>
      <div class='line in4'>On board of the Arethusa.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Arethusa, which flew the broad pennant of Commodore
Tyrwhitt (this is the special flag always flown by
commodores), was chosen for the honour of leading the
attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the head of a line of destroyers, which are small but
very fast vessels, she sallied forth, intending to cut off the
German ships and drive them into the open sea, there to
fight them at leisure. But two German cruisers attacked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>her first at a distance of nearly two miles. This seems
a long way, but naval guns can shoot much further than
that. The Germans did her some damage, but she drove
them off, and one of them she seriously injured.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on in the morning she fought two other German
ships, and helped to sink the Mainz. In these actions she
suffered so much that many of her guns were made useless
and her speed was lessened to ten knots, which of course
is very slow.</p>

<p class='c011'>About one o’clock the gallant Arethusa was discovered
in her crippled condition by two German cruisers, and
they would certainly have sunk her if British ships had
not come to the rescue. These ships turned the tables
with a vengeance, for they chased and sank the Germans
in their turn.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Arethusa had done splendidly, all the more
splendidly you will agree when you hear that she had
only been commissioned a few days before. “Commissioned”
means got ready for service, with crew, guns,
stores, and everything necessary for going to sea. Thus,
her officers and crew were new to one another and the
ship was new to them, and yet they could not have fought
better.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The whole Empire felt a thrill of pride in the exploit
of the Arethusa. In far-off Johannesburg 2081 miners
clubbed together, paying a penny each to send a telegram
congratulating Commodore Tyrwhitt and his whole ship’s
company on their victory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fighting at sea is, I think, in some ways more dreadful
than fighting on land. There is the same terrible distance
from the enemy, and the shells make the same fearful
screaming noise in the air. But if your ship is struck
a mortal blow, you seem to have less chance than you
would have in land fighting, especially if your ship blows
up before sinking.</p>

<p class='c011'>But that is a landsman’s feeling. You may be sure
that our gallant tars do not trouble their heads whether
the danger is more or less. Indeed, this Heligoland
action showed most vividly that the modern Navy is
worthy of all her glorious traditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>I must tell you about Lieut.-Commander Barttelot
and his gallant little destroyer, the Liberty. She and the
other destroyers did not hesitate to engage much bigger
and stronger German ships, and naturally they got knocked
about a bit.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>After the funnel of the Liberty had been shot away,
this brave officer stood on the bridge and gave his orders
as quietly as if he were at a sham fight. A shell shot
off one of his legs, but he seized the rails of the bridge,
steadied himself, and continued giving his commands.
Shortly after another shell struck the Liberty and
killed him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not less thrilling is the story of Lieut.-Commander
Frank Rose, of the destroyer Laurel, who was seriously
wounded in the left leg. His men urged him to go below,
but he simply shifted the weight on to the other leg and
continued to issue his orders. Soon his one sound leg
was struck by a shell, and down he came on the bridge,
but he still declined to go below. His signalman tore
off his trousers to prevent the wound from being poisoned,
and to this act of thoughtful devotion Lieut.-Commander
Rose probably owed his life. As at last he lay swooning
on the bridge, one of his petty officers fastened a lifebelt
round him.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time there only remained three rounds of
ammunition, and it appeared as if the little Laurel could
not live much longer in the fire to which she was then
exposed. But she did.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The gallantry of all our seamen was indeed something
to be proud of, and it was shown by fighters and non-fighters
alike.</p>

<p class='c011'>For example, the surgeon of the Arethusa, who was,
as I have explained, new to the ship like the others, was
a marvel of coolness. Before she was struck he busied
himself in handing out ammunition to the gunners, and
when the casualties began he stuck to his work of healing
under fire. He hadn’t time to dress properly, so there he
was, wearing red leather slippers, uniform trousers, and
the coat of his pyjamas!</p>

<p class='c013'>One officer of the Arethusa had his leg grazed by a
shell which fell five or six feet behind him. He was hurled
along the deck, and appeared to be much relieved when
he discovered that both his legs had not been shot away.
But they were badly bruised. There were no crutches
on board, so one of the crew gave him a pair of
broomsticks, by the aid of which he stuck to his post
and hobbled round giving his orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>This action, the Battle of the Bight as it was called,
inspired many poets. To my mind by far the finest it
called forth was by Mr. William Watson. In it he addresses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the mighty dead of the sea service, and his last
verse runs:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sleep on, O Drake, sleep well!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thou hast thy heart’s desire.</div>
      <div class='line'>Grenville, whom nought could quell,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thou dost hand on thy fire.</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou that had’st no peer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nelson! thou need’st not fear:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy sons and heirs are here,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor shall they shame their sire.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The sea has always bred heroes. At the Battle of
Trafalgar one of the French captains had both his legs
shot off. He had himself placed in a barrel of bran, and
went on directing his men in the hour of defeat to the end.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the Battle of the Nile a little midshipman, only
fourteen years old, named John Hindmarsh, gave the
order which saved the Bellerophon. Seeing that the fire
in L’Orient would spread to the Bellerophon, he got some
men down and cut her cable and then had the sprit-sail
set. The captain was below, having a wound dressed,
and the first lieutenant was also below on duty. Hindmarsh
was publicly thanked by Nelson himself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Then it was wooden ships and sails; now it is ships of
steel and complicated machinery. But the spirit of Navy
men remains every whit as cool and gallant.</p>

<p class='c013'>This first naval action off Heligoland also showed the
splendid chivalry of our seamen.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the German ships were seen to be sinking, the
British commanders ordered the destroyers to cease fire.
All boats were lowered to pick up survivors; but while
this was being done, German destroyers and cruisers
actually opened a heavy fire on the boats. Our destroyers
were thus forced to retire, and one of them, the Defender,
generously left her boat to the German prisoners, nearly
all of whom were wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet more. The commanding officer of Submarine E4,
after covering the retreat of one of the destroyers, returned
to the boats and removed the British officers and
men. He might also have taken a German officer and six
unwounded men prisoners, but as there were eighteen
Germans very badly wounded, he humanely left the
officer and unwounded men to care for them and navigate
the boats which contained them. He did something else.
He provided the boats with water, biscuits, and a compass,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and he generously gave the officer the position and course
to Heligoland. As for the officer and men of the Defender,
they stripped themselves of everything but their trousers
and tore up their clothes to serve as bandages for the
wounded Germans.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some days afterwards a high German official actually
asserted that British seamen had fired on the Germans
swimming in the water. It is from the reply which
our Admiralty made to this cowardly charge that the
above facts are taken. As a matter of fact, I am sorry to
tell you that some of the German officers fired at their
own men in the water with revolvers.</p>

<p class='c013'>A letter written by a sailor who took part in the Heligoland
action told a pretty story of his ship’s pet:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our dear little black lucky kitten sat under our
foremost gun during the whole of the battle, and wasn’t
frightened at all, only when we first started firing. But
afterwards she sat and licked herself. We all kissed her
afterwards!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sailors are known to be extremely fond of animals.
The Naval Volunteers at the Crystal Palace soon acquired
two pets—a kitten and a whippet. The latter always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>had a red, white, and blue ribbon tied to each of his legs
and to his tail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soldiers, too, are very fond of pets. The story goes
that on one occasion a sergeant appeared on his troopship
with a little woolly dog. The quartermaster on duty
refused to allow the animal on board. The sergeant
thought awhile, and then went on shore. An hour later
he came back with a cage. In it was a very queer-looking
creature, which, though it had four feet, was covered
with hen’s feathers. “Can’t pass that there dog on
board,” said the quartermaster. “Dog?” said the sergeant.
“This ain’t no dog. It’s a Maltese four-footed
Bird of Paradise, and there’s no rules against taking birds
on board!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The laugh was with him, and his pet was allowed on
board ship.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c015'>On September 22 the Germans scored a success against
us with a submarine attack. This resulted in the loss of
three cruisers, the Aboukir, Hogue, and Cressy. These
were all old ships, and as a matter of fact were afloat for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the last time, as the Admiralty had decided to sell them
for breaking up. What could not be replaced was the
loss of some twelve hundred officers and men. Only
about eight hundred and fifty were saved out of over
two thousand.</p>

<p class='c013'>I expect that most of you have seen a picture of a submarine,
but I do not suppose that any of you know very
much about this extraordinary deep-sea fighting ship,
which has been well said to wear the cloak of darkness.
The submarine can attack unseen with the deadly weapon
of the torpedo, and she can retreat undiscovered. But
she is rather slow and she is what is called blind in attack;
she has to come up to the surface before she can see exactly
where her enemy is. It is said that if she could get along
more quickly than she does she could do a great deal more
mischief. Still, when commanded and manned by cool,
brave men, and when she has luck on her side, she can do
quite mischief enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>The disaster would probably not have happened if
the three cruisers had had with them their usual escort
of destroyers—those speedy little craft which are the terror
of submarines. Unfortunately, the weather was very bad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and the destroyers were delayed. This was the opportunity
for which the German submarine, commanded by
Lieut.-Commander Weddingen, had long been waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cruisers were on patrol duty somewhere off the
Hook of Holland. They did not see the tiny periscope of
the submarine, as it emerged amid the ruffled waters.
The German had nine torpedoes to fire, and she had plenty
of time to choose her first victim. This was the Aboukir.
Lieut.-Commander Weddingen himself thought his torpedo
hit the cruiser under one of her magazines, which
by exploding helped to destroy the ship. However that
may be, the Aboukir soon broke up and sank, and of
course her sister ships stopped and lowered boats to
rescue as many as possible of the crew.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alas! the moment the Hogue stopped she became
an easy mark. The German submarine gave her two
torpedoes in quick succession, and in about five minutes
the Hogue had gone to the bottom and the sea was covered
with men, some swimming for dear life, others clinging
to tables, stools, chairs, planks, etc., which had been
thrown off the ship. Not immediately, but soon afterwards,
the Cressy was torpedoed and sank.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The brotherhood of the sea is very strong, and British
seamen are always generous in their appreciation of an
enemy’s bravery. They admired the daring of the German
submarine, but they could not help being sorry for the fact
that it meanly advanced under cover of a German trawler
which had hoisted the Dutch flag. Further, one regrets
to have to add that the trawler made no attempt to save
our drowning seamen, in this forming a very great contrast
to the British tars who always do their very best to
rescue their drowning enemies.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there came up two trawlers, which were really
Dutch, the Flora and the Titan, and their captains and
crews worked like heroes to save the lives of our men.
They took many hundreds to Holland, where the British
seamen were most kindly treated, being fed and clothed
and sent back to England after resting. Some of our
poor fellows died of the cold and exposure in the sea,
and these the kindly Dutchmen buried with all honour
and reverence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mishap was a sad blow to the nation, all the
more because it was seen that the Hogue and the Cressy
really met their doom owing to their efforts to save the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>crew of the Aboukir. But everybody drew comfort from
the splendid gallantry shown by all our seamen, from the
captains downwards. Yet many as were the stories of
brave deeds which came to light, we may be sure that at
least as many more will never be known, the eye-witnesses
having all perished. I will give you a few examples of
deeds which did come to light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Do you remember the cool, brave surgeon on the
Arethusa? There was one equally brave and resourceful
on the Cressy. Together with four men, he was clinging
to some wreckage, and he instructed his comrades to rub
each other’s legs with their naked feet alternately, and so
keep their blood circulating. They hung on for two or
three hours, and finally all were rescued, no doubt owing
to the surgeon’s clever idea.</p>

<p class='c013'>One survivor wrote after his awful ordeal:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The best thing I saw was the coolness of a little
cadet. Not more than fourteen he looked. He drifted
near me, he and a seaman clinging with their hands and
elbows on the same bit of wood. I never saw anything
so calm as that lad! He was talking to the seaman with
him. ‘Well,’ he says, ‘we’ve got to carry on like this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and if we die we shall die game.’ And with that he begins
to talk about everyday things on the sunken ship. ‘What’s
the new chief engineer like?’ he says, and chats about
little incidents in the mess. Only fourteen, a little light-haired
boy. I hope he was saved.”</p>

<p class='c013'>What a splendid, lion-hearted boy! Was he saved?
you will ask. I cannot be sure, but I think he was.</p>

<p class='c013'>Midshipman Cazalet of the Cressy, aged sixteen, saved
no fewer than eighty-eight lives, including one of his own
officers. When Mr. Cazalet saw that the Aboukir had
been hit, he went out in the Cressy’s whaler and picked
up twenty-five men. He took them to the picket boat
of the Hogue, and went back for more. Altogether he
picked up two more boatloads, and it was not till he could
see no more survivors that he himself took refuge on
board the Dutch trawler Titan.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little drummer-boy of the Marines, Cecil Kneller,
who was only fifteen, had a great adventure, for he kept
himself afloat in the water for about four hours with the
aid of an empty rum cask. And when he got back to his
father, who is a railway porter living at Chatham, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>noticed that he was just as rosy-cheeked as when he went
away! So he did not suffer much from his long bath.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am sorry to tell you that Captain Johnson, of the
Cressy, was not among the saved. This very gallant gentleman
was last seen on the bridge of his ship, carefully tying
leaden weights round a parcel, which he dropped into the
sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Can you guess what was in that parcel? It was the
secret signal-book of the ship, and it was most important
that it should not fall into the hands of the enemy. If the
enemy had got hold of it, then they would have been able
to read the signals with which our ships talk to one another,
and that might easily have led to a terrible disaster.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Johnson was determined that that should not
happen, and when he had cast the parcel into the sea, he
went down with his ship contented, for he had done his
duty.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c015'>Much excitement was caused by the exploits of the
German cruiser Emden, which took and sank over twenty
British merchantmen, and disposed of several warships.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Her commander, Captain von Müller, behaved chivalrously
to the crews of his prizes, treating them well while in
his power, and sending them to the nearest port. This
contrast with the behaviour of the Germans on land made
everybody realise the brotherhood of the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the first time in any big war, the fastest ocean
liners on both sides were armed with naval guns and turned
into warships. I am going to tell you about a most exciting
duel between two of these armed liners, which happened
on September 14. Some of you may have crossed the
Atlantic to America in the White Star liner Carmania,
and if so you will read with all the more interest the
story of her victory over the German ship Cap Trafalgar.</p>

<p class='c013'>You will easily understand that when the Carmania was
taken over by the British Navy and became H.M.S. Carmania,
a good many changes were made. The comfortable
quarters for passengers, the splendid state-rooms
and luxurious berths, were ripped out, because fire is a
great danger in a warship and anything that will burn
is usually thrown overboard when she goes into action.
Even as it was, a shell from the enemy did set the Carmania
on fire, as we shall see.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Fights between single ships are, I think, in some ways
more exciting than big battles. At any rate, it is easier
to understand them. When it is a case of only two ships,
we can imagine ourselves on board one of them and looking
on at the struggle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Have you ever heard how the gallant Captain Broke,
of H.M.S. Shannon, engaged and defeated the American
warship Chesapeake? That was when we were at war
with America, just a hundred years ago. The duel took
place outside New York Harbour, in sight of land, and
crowds came out to see the sight. Their feelings must
have been very mixed, for the Chesapeake struck her flag
after a short and very violent fight. But as the Americans
are a brave and generous people, they must have applauded
the clever seamanship of gallant Captain Broke.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may remember, too, the plucky fight of the little
Revenge against enormous odds, and Tennyson’s noble
ballad in which the story is told.</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot tell you why the Germans named their ship
Cap Trafalgar, after the scene of Nelson’s last and greatest
victory, especially as there is a splendid ship named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Trafalgar in the British Navy. But it does not much
matter, as the Cap Trafalgar now lies at the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crew of the Carmania were just sitting down to
their mid-day dinner when the look-out men sounded
the alarm. Instantly everyone tumbled up and went to
his place, and all eyes were turned on a big ship lying
about five miles off, as big as the Carmania herself, and
looking like a liner. In fact, the Germans, with their
usual cunning, had painted her two funnels to look like a
Union-Castle liner. The Cap Trafalgar was pretending to
be a British ship!</p>

<p class='c013'>The trick did her no good, however; the captain of
the Carmania was not running any risks. “Give her a
shot,” he cried, “but don’t hit her.” The gun-layer
gave her a neat shot just across her bows, and at that
instant the stranger opened fire. The Carmania replied
with all her port guns, and the fight immediately became
furious.</p>

<p class='c013'>The German was beaten for two reasons. First,
because he fired too high, only smashing the Carmania’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>masts and rigging, whereas we put in most of our shots
right on the German’s water-line. Secondly, because the
Carmania was much better handled, her captain turning
her so that the enemy could only fire at her endways and
not sideways.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cap Trafalgar took fire in the forward part, but
still she gallantly went on fighting. When at last she
decided to try and escape, she found it was too late.
Already she was sinking, and the men of the Carmania,
which had by this time practically ceased firing, saw a
very curious thing. They saw the enemy turn over on
her side, so that they could look right down her funnels,
which were level with the water. Even then the German
ship did not haul down her flag. There was an explosion
and her bows went under; then another explosion and
the great vessel sank. All the honours of war to this
brave foe!</p>

<p class='c013'>The Cap Trafalgar made 304 holes in the Carmania,
but only two of them were serious shots in the side of the
ship. This was not very good shooting when you think
that the Carmania is 675 feet long—longer than many a
London street—and stands 60 feet out of the water, as tall
as a tall house.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The most serious damage done to the Carmania was
by a shell, which set her on fire under her fore-bridge,
and made steering difficult. The fire spread so much
that it prevented the Carmania’s men from going to the
rescue of the Germans in the water. But before she sank
five boats put off from the Cap Trafalgar, and I am glad
to say they were all rescued by a coal-ship—two hundred
and seventy-nine officers and men.</p>

<p class='c013'>So much for this exciting little fight. The two ships
were almost exactly equal in size and strength, and the
British vessel won on her merits by better seamanship and
better gunnery. No wonder the Navy was pleased.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>

<p class='c015'>Now I must tell you about Lieut.-Commander Max
K. Horton, of Submarine E9, and how he earned the
nickname of “The Double-toothed Pirate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>You know how terribly dangerous the submarine service
is. These ships are long and narrow, shaped rather like
a cigar, and they can travel a long way under the water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>But they are very fragile, and their gallant crews are
always ready for instant death.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day before the Carmania sank the Cap Trafalgar,
September 13, Lieut.-Commander Horton took a little
trip out to the Frisian Islands in E9. He found the German
light cruiser Hela and sank her with a torpedo, and
got away without being seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The loss of the Hela herself did not matter much to
the Germans, as she was nearly ten years old and not of
much fighting value. But what did matter was the upset
to the nerves of the Germans. This is a most valuable
thing in war—to make your enemy feel “jumpy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is said that E9 came back to Harwich flying a little
yellow flag bearing a skull and crossbones, which, as you
probably know, is the badge of the Kaiser’s favourite
regiment of Brandenburg Hussars.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next exploit of E9 was even more daring, even
more certain to make the Germans “jumpy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again the little ship went off to the Frisian Islands,
and there she torpedoed and sank a German destroyer.
If you look at the map, you will see how close these islands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>are to the German naval stations of Wilhelmshaven and
Emden. What should we have felt if a German submarine
had come up and sunk a British ship quite close
to Portsmouth and Plymouth? However, the War may
bring us worse surprises than that, and if it does we must
bear them bravely.</p>

<p class='c013'>E9 had an exciting time. While she was watching
for her prey, she saw a big German cruiser and she had
to dive. When she came up again, the cruiser had gone,
but there was a destroyer instead, and this she marked
down. At one time she was actually too near the destroyer
to fire a torpedo because it would have been dangerous
to herself. At last she got about six hundred yards off
and then she fired two torpedoes, one after the other. The
first missed, but the second hit the destroyer fairly in the
middle and blew her to pieces. Another German destroyer
which was near hastily ran away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lieut.-Commander Horton and his gallant men returned
to Harwich flying the little yellow flag, and underneath
it a little white flag, also bearing the grim device of
a skull and crossbones. It was then that he was given
the jesting nickname of “The Double-toothed Pirate,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>for as you know the skull and crossbones has always
been the emblem of pirates.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not myself like this nickname, for Lieut.-Commander
Horton is by no means a pirate. On the contrary,
he always fights fair. He is as clever as he is brave, and
he has always been a great believer in submarines, which
he has been studying for years. When he was serving in
H.M.S. Duke of Edinburgh he won a gold medal for
saving life. That was when the Delhi went ashore with
the Princess Royal and the late Duke of Fife and their
children on board.</p>

<p class='c013'>An amusing story is told which shows the coolness of
submarine officers. One of these gallant fellows, finding
that the enemy could see him on the surface by daylight,
sank his boat to the bottom and waited for night. Someone
asked him what he did all that time. “I did very
well,” he said, “we played auction bridge, and I won
4s. 11½d.” But games like this at the bottom of the sea
are the great exception.</p>

<p class='c013'>Never forget our seamen and what they are doing for
us in storm, in cold, and in fog. If you have the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>fortune to be related to a boy or man in the Navy, write
to him regularly and tell him all the home news. He will
love to hear it, and, busy as he may be, will probably find
time to answer you. But if you don’t hear for a long
time, remember that the delightful verses—with only one
word altered—which were written by the Earl of Dorset
at sea in 1665 are as true now as they were two hundred
and fifty years ago:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Just before the war broke out, a friend of mine
took her three grandchildren for a holiday to
Wimereux, a French seaside place near Boulogne.
They were quite little children, the youngest indeed being
still a baby. On the day that my friend knew that war
was certain she was naturally very anxious to get the
children safely back to England.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>That night she sent them to bed early, and she herself
did not sit up late. On her way to her room she looked
in on the children to see if they wanted anything.
To her surprise, only the baby was in bed. The two
elder ones had drawn up the blind and were looking out
of the window on the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Granny!” they cried, “do come and look!”</p>

<p class='c011'>My friend went and stood beside them, and there,
spread out before her in the moonlight, she saw a most
wonderful sight, one that no Englishwoman could look
upon without a thrill of pride.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beyond the fort built by Napoleon, beyond a rock
on which stood a solitary French sentinel leaning on
his rifle, the whole sea was covered with the British Fleet,
ship after ship in regular lines—Dreadnoughts, cruisers,
all with their attendant torpedo-boats, destroyers, and
submarines.</p>

<p class='c011'>There they lay, with none of the bravery of flags flying
and bands playing, as when the King reviews his Fleet,
but cold and vigilant, all stripped for action. Not a man
could be seen on board—only the long guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>The children, looking on, partly understood the silent
strength of that great armada of warships, and they went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>back to bed contented with their grandmother’s promise
to tell them all about it to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next morning the children ran to the window, but
the British Fleet had gone, vanished as silently as it had
come, and the sea was almost clear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has happened? Why have the ships gone?”
The children pressed my friend with eager questions,
and as you will also want to put the same questions, I
cannot do better than tell you what she told them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great war with Germany had begun, and the British
Fleet had gone eastwards to the North Sea, there to
watch for the German Fleet!</p>

<p class='c013'>But the most wonderful thing was that now, after a
hundred years, British soldiers were going to fight again
on the Continent. Almost exactly a hundred years ago
Wellington, aided by German troops, had finally crushed
Napoleon on the field of Waterloo. But now the
British and the French were fast friends, and they
were going to fight shoulder to shoulder against the
German hosts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>A great writer, who was even greater as a poet, George
Meredith, wrote some noble lines on this new-found
friendship. I quote one verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Joy that no more with murder’s frown</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The ancient rivals bark apart.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now Nelson to brave France is shown</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A hero after her own heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>And he now scanning that quick race</div>
      <div class='line'>To whom through life his glove was thrown,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would know a sister spirit to embrace.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>You must never think of the past as if it were something
quite different from the present. In some ways
this great war brings us much nearer the glorious old
England which was always at war in Flanders, as Belgium
was then called.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those old heroical conflicts of long ago produced some
wonderful books. Let us hope that the time will come
when some great writer of the future will create as vividly
real a man as Sterne’s Uncle Toby.</p>

<p class='c013'>After being wounded at the siege of Namur, Uncle
Toby spent his peaceful old age in following Marlborough’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>army on his bowling-green. Sterne describes
how the old man set up model fortifications with batteries,
saps, ditches, and palisadoes, and so, with the help of maps
and books as well as of Corporal Trim, his soldier servant,
he was able to fight over again, not only his old battles
but those that were still going on.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Uncle Toby of the future will set up miniature
pieces of artillery and tiny trenches in place of the batteries
and palisadoes of the past. Let us hope, however, that he
will be as noble-hearted and kindly a man as his famous
predecessor.</p>

<p class='c013'>When you are older, I hope you will read and re-read
this wonderful book, which is called “Tristram Shandy.”
I will only add here Uncle Toby’s defence of Britain at
war, because it applies so well to the present War with
Germany.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is War,” he asked, “what is it, when fought as
ours has been, upon Principles of <em>Liberty</em> and Principles
of <em>Honour</em>, what is it but the Getting together of Quiet
and Harmless People with their Swords in their
Hands, to keep the Ambitious and Turbulent within
Bounds?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>I cannot help feeling rather sorry that most of you
will not remember what the British Army was like before
the days of khaki. I am rather sorry for myself that I
cannot remember the time when our troops wore the occasionally
beautiful, the always quaint, and the sometimes
grotesque uniforms which you see in old pictures and
engravings. At the Naval and Military Tournament every
year some of the old picturesque uniforms and the curious
old drill are revived. I remember, in particular, how
Sir Mark Sykes with wonderful skill brought to life
again before us in this way a company of the famous
“Green Howards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Not much more than a hundred years ago, soldiers
all wore pigtails, but both officers and men hated them,
and when at last they were abolished, in 1808, some of the
regiments actually made bonfires of their pigtails while
others buried them!</p>

<p class='c013'>The French still wear the blue and red uniform, and
sad to say it is greatly owing to that fact that they have
suffered so terribly from the German fire. It seems that
an airman, even when flying very high, sees the bright
patches of blue lying beneath him, when the British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>khaki, and even more the greenish-grey German uniform,
would be quite invisible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of you, I am sure, have been to Boulogne, either
to spend a happy summer holiday there, or when going
through to some other part of France. Henceforth we
shall all look upon the beautiful old French port with
a new interest and a new respect. For there the British
Expeditionary Force landed in August 1914.</p>

<p class='c013'>Till that date Boulogne was chiefly famous as having
been the “jumping-off place” from which Napoleon
planned to make a victorious invasion of England. It
was the Battle of Waterloo which saved us from that invasion.
So Boulogne had a long and intimate acquaintance
with British warriors, but never till this year in the guise
of friends. The noble ghosts of these British warriors
were evoked in splendid fashion in the following lines
by Mr. Justin Huntly M‘Carthy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One dreamer, when our English soldiers trod</div>
      <div class='line'>But yesterday the welcoming fields of France,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw war-gaunt shadows gathering stare askance</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon those levies and that alien sod—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Saw Churchill’s smile and Wellington’s curt nod,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw Harry with his Crispins, Chandos’ lance,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Edwards on whose breasts the leopards dance:</div>
      <div class='line'>Then heard a gust of ghostly thanks to God</div>
      <div class='line'>That the most famous quarrel of all time</div>
      <div class='line'>In the most famous friendship ends at last;</div>
      <div class='line'>Such flame of friendship as God fans to forge</div>
      <div class='line'>A sword to strike the Dragon of the Slime,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bidding St. Denis with St. George stand fast</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the Worm. St. Denis and St. George!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I ought perhaps to explain that “Churchill’s smile”
does not mean the smile of Mr. Winston Churchill, but of
his great ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough. The Worm
is of course an old name for the Dragon and stands in
this case for Germany, and St. Denis is the old battle-cry
of France, as St. George is that of England.</p>

<p class='c013'>In spite of what people may tell you to the contrary,
never believe that a secret cannot be kept. Honourable
people always keep a secret. It shows how very many
honourable people there must be, both in England and
in France, when I tell you that the fact that this wonderful
force of 110,000 men with all their guns and stores was
being taken across to France, was never publicly revealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>till Lord Kitchener allowed it to be announced in the
newspapers.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet what was happening day by day and hour
by hour must have been known to thousands of people
in both countries. The reason for this secrecy was, as
you can easily guess, to furnish a nice little surprise
for the enemy. And that it was a real surprise for the
enemy is proved by a German Army Order, which afterwards
fell into our hands, referring to a rumour that a
British force might be coming. That Army Order was
dated August 21, after the whole force had landed!</p>

<p class='c013'>I want you particularly to understand also that it is a
difficult job to take an army of horse and foot and guns
across even so short a bit of sea as the English Channel.
It takes many big ships, called transports, and they have
to be most carefully guarded by warships while they are
crossing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Never forget that if it had not been for the British
Navy the Army could never have got across the Channel
safely. Nor could the constant stream of fresh troops
and horses and food and shells and cartridges and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the other hundred and one things that an army needs
in the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Everything possible was done to prevent the enemy
from knowing about the force which was being sent against
him. The regiments left their depots in ignorance of
where they were being sent. Even the drivers of the
engines which drew the trains to Southampton were not
told their destination beforehand. Most wonderful of all,
the captain of each ship bearing a thousand or more
soldiers started out from Southampton not knowing
whither he was bound till he was ten miles from shore.
Then he opened a sealed envelope containing his orders.
Of course everyone had a shrewd suspicion, but there was
no talking, no gossip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Equally in the dark were the people of Boulogne,
though they must have known great events were astir,
for they could not help seeing some of the preparations
which had to be made for receiving such an army.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he left our shores each soldier received a message
from the King and a message from Lord Kitchener.
This is the whole of the King’s message:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“You are leaving home to fight for the safety and
honour of my Empire. Belgium, which country we are
pledged to defend, has been attacked, and France is about
to be invaded by the same powerful foe. I have implicit
confidence in you, my soldiers. Duty is your watchword
and I know your duty will be nobly done. I shall follow
your every moment with deepest interest and mark with
eager satisfaction your daily progress. Indeed, your welfare
will never be absent from my thoughts. I pray God
to bless you and guard you and bring you back victorious.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>George</span> R. et I.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“R. et I.” means “Rex et Imperator,” the Latin for
King and Emperor, for the King is also Emperor of India.</p>

<p class='c013'>The message from Lord Kitchener was a good deal
longer, and I will only give you these sentences from what
has been well described as the noblest message ever sent
to fighting men:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are ordered abroad as a soldier of the King
to help our French comrades against the invasion of a
common enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember that the honour of the British Empire
depends on your individual conduct, and you can do your
country no better service than in showing yourself in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>France and Belgium in the true character of a British
soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be invariably courteous, considerate, and kind. Always
look upon looting as a disgraceful act. You are sure
to meet with a welcome and to be trusted; your conduct
must justify that welcome and that trust.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do your duty bravely. Fear God. Honour the
King.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Kitchener</span>, Field-Marshal.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was rather a fine touch of the French military authorities
to set aside for the British Army the exact stretch of
ground where Napoleon encamped <em>his</em> Expeditionary
Force nearly a century before. The more we know about
this war, the more wonderful a man Napoleon turns out
to have been. Even in this matter of choosing the best
and healthiest spot for a camp, the modern commanders
could not do better than follow closely in his firm
footsteps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of us who have been to Boulogne must have
driven or walked to the column which the town put up
many years ago to the memory of England’s great enemy.
How strange to think that British soldiers rested, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>starting out on the most serious venture in their history,
under the very shadow of that column!</p>

<p class='c013'>The people of Boulogne—or one ought to say what
was left of them, for of course their husbands, sons,
and brothers were already at the front—gave our troops
a most wonderful welcome. This was, however, but a
foretaste of how they were to be treated in every district
of France traversed by them. As many of our soldiers
wrote home, they were in some cases almost killed with
kindness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of our troops were fortunate enough to remain at
Boulogne ten days. Others only had a few hours’ rest
before they were hurried up to the front. Yet others
again left the camp full of high spirits, with laughter and
happy <em>au revoirs</em>, to come back within a very few days
wounded and on their way to hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'>As you all know, the command of the British Force
was given to Field-Marshal Sir John French, and you
may like me to tell you something of this great soldier.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first interesting thing about him is that, perhaps
owing to the fact that his father was a naval officer, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>served for a time in the Navy as a midshipman. Then
he became a lieutenant in the Militia, or, as we should say
now, the Territorials, and afterwards joined the 19th
Hussars. He soon showed the splendid stuff he was
made of, both in peace and in war. I think you
will like to know that he was among those British
officers who made the last desperate attempt to rescue
General Gordon.</p>

<p class='c011'>He is what is called a great cavalry leader, and it has
been said that what Murat was to Napoleon, French
proved himself to be to Roberts and to Kitchener during
the South African War. If a service of great hazard and
peril had to be performed, it was always French and his
men who were asked to do it.</p>

<p class='c013'>But what I want you to remember about Sir John
French is, not only that he is a great soldier and a very
brave man, but also that he is a singularly modest man.
In each and all of his despatches during this great war he
has always under-estimated his victories, in this setting
an example which has not been followed by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir John French has another very rare quality, and one
which some famous military commanders have lacked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>I mean the quality of generosity. There is not in his
nature a touch of envy, or of that feeling which has sometimes
made even very great men dislike and deplore any
kind of rivalry. He has paid noble tributes to the officers
working under him, and his commendation of his gallant
army must have filled every man of them with a glow of
pride and pleasure. Among the rank and file, who call
him among themselves simply “Johnny,” he is almost
worshipped, and they have the most absolute belief in his
powers of leadership.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like all great cavalry leaders, Sir John French is exceedingly
fond of horses. He felt bitterly the death of a
favourite charger which had carried him through the
whole of the South African campaign, and which wore
a medal round its neck recording its services. Sir John
French had this good horse buried at Aldershot, and a
memorial now marks the gallant charger’s grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may be interested to learn that Napoleon’s charger,
a small, thick-set barb, lives in many a noble painting.
He spent his old age at the Jardin des Plantes, the “Zoo”
of Paris, and used to be regularly visited by the members
of his master’s Old Guard.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>As for the Duke of Wellington’s famous horse, Copenhagen,
familiar in many pictures, he was remarkable for
his endurance, and however hard a day he had gone
through—on one occasion Copenhagen carried the Iron
Duke for sixteen hours at a stretch—he never refused his
corn, which he used to eat very oddly, lying down. When
he died of old age at Strathfieldsaye, he was buried with
military honours.</p>

<p class='c013'>Crimean Bob was for a long time the oldest horse in
the British Army. He was a pretty, chestnut-coloured
horse, and joined as a four-year-old in 1833. In 1842,
he went on foreign service for the first time. He came
back without a scratch, and embarked for the Crimea in
1854. He was ridden in the Charge of the Light Brigade—the
story of which you know from Tennyson’s famous
poem, “Half a league, half a league, half a league onward”—as
well as all through the battles of the Alma and
Inkerman. During the whole of the campaign he was
never once struck off duty through sickness. On his
return home he was carefully looked after at Cahir Barracks
in Ireland till his death, which took place at an extraordinary
old age.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Perhaps the thing which first made many of the country
people in peaceful England understand that we were
<em>really</em> at war, was what is called the “requisitioning” of
horses. Supposing one of you had been leading a horse
along a lane near home, you might, and almost certainly
would, have been suddenly ordered to hand it over to be
used for army purposes, of course at a fair price.</p>

<p class='c013'>I heard of one venerable lady who was taking a nice
drive, as she always did for an hour every afternoon. Her
two fat horses were being driven, as always, by her fat old
coachman, when suddenly an officer jumped out of a wood
at the side of the road and politely requested her to hand
them over!</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady was very much agitated, and the coachman
pleaded that he might at least take his mistress home.
“Yes, if you give me your word to have the horses
back here within an hour.” “And what is to happen to
me? It’s my living you’re taking away, sir!” “Oh,
you can come too, and look after your horses!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A pretty little story was told about the same time.
A mare arrived at a well-known depot with other
requisitioned animals. Tied round her neck was a label,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>with a tiny sprig of heather fastened by a piece of blue silk
ribbon. The label bore the brief but pathetic message:
“Sorry Lady has to leave us. Hope she will return to
us safe and sound. With much love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This appeal found its way to a soldier’s heart, and he
wrote from Woolwich to the <cite>Daily Sketch</cite>:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should be obliged if you would inform Ivy Clayton
that her little horse has arrived here safe and well, and
that she can rest assured that ‘Lady’ will receive every
attention during her brief stay with us. Sincerely hoping
that she will soon recover her pet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Gunner</span> R.H.A.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But to return to Sir John French and his officers.
This word “officer” is so familiar that I do not suppose
anyone of you has ever stopped to think what it means.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ideal officer is gallant, intelligent, and energetic.
He is aware that influence over his men is not obtained
by discipline alone, but by kindness, firmness, and good
sense. He explains to a certain extent to the men under
him the reasons for his orders. He does not require
of them the blind obedience which is exacted by the
German officer. In fact, I cannot do better than quote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the description given by a certain corporal in an old
comedy called <cite>The Poor Gentleman</cite>:</p>

<p class='c011'>“A good officer, do you see, cannot help being a kind-hearted
man. Ship an officer, we will say, with his company
to a foreign climate; he lands and endures heat,
cold, and fatigue, hunger, thirst, sickness; now marching
over the burning plain, now up to his knees in wet in the
trench; how could a man suffer such hardships with a
parcel of honest fellows under his command, and not
learn to feel for his fellow-creatures?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is because our officers are good officers that the men
follow them to the death. It is because they are not only
firm and just, but also kind, that they are loved, honoured,
and obeyed. A soldier never fails his officer if he has
confidence in him, and if he knows he will never be
asked for undue exertion unless the good of the service
requires it.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the passage across the Channel of our Expeditionary
Force many wonderful deeds of daring were done
by our brave airmen. One such was considered so remarkable
as to be told in the official news later despatched
from the front, and it is, I think, difficult to beat for cool
courage.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>During one of the airship patrols it became necessary
to change a propeller blade of one of the engines. The
captain feared it would be necessary to descend for this
purpose, but two of the crew immediately volunteered to
carry out this difficult task in the air. Climbing out on
to the bracket, carrying the propeller shafting, they completed
the hazardous work of changing the blade 2000
feet above the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a long time before some of us realised that not
only England, Scotland, and Ireland, but also the Greater
Britain on which the sun never sets, had gone to war.
Gallant deeds are being performed every day all over
the Empire, and it is only by accident that we hear of
some of them. The War enormously increased their
number.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take, for instance, the magnificent courage shown by
Mr. Saxby Wellacott, the son of the Vicar of Totnes. This
young man is not a soldier but a civilian attached to the
Public Works Department at Accra, in West Africa. Yet
he played an active part in the operations of the Field
Force which added Togoland to our Empire early in
August. The Germans put up a good fight. They mined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the roads and railways and electrified the wire entanglements;
but it is also reported that they used dum-dum
bullets, which as you know is not fair fighting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Wellacott, together with two French officers and
thirty Senegalese troops, advanced on a river called the
Chra. The Germans blew up a bridge and opened fire
on the tiny allied force with three Maxim guns and a couple
of hundred rifles. The firing went on for two hours, and
Mr. Wellacott got left behind. He managed, however,
to get back to his motor-cycle, started it and rode it for
five miles with a wounded man in the side-car. Most
wonderful of all, he succeeded in carrying the motor-cycle
over two bridges, though it weighed six hundredweight.
At last to his great joy he found the main column
but rest was not for him yet. The Allied forces had to
fight all day the next day, achieving victory the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Germans were foolish enough to think when the
war broke out that there would be terrible trouble in
Ireland, a rebellion in India, and that the great Dominions—Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa—would
seize the opportunity to desert the Empire.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>As a matter of fact, the very opposite of these things
happened. Irishmen of all parties rushed to enlist. A
great wave of passionate loyalty swept over India. Her
Princes and her peoples poured out their offerings of men
and money. Regiments of magnificent native soldiers—Rajputs,
Sikhs, Gurkhas, Pathans—were granted the
dearest wish of their hearts, namely to fight shoulder to
shoulder with our white troops.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for the Dominions, most valuable help in men and
money was instantly offered by Canada, Australia, and
New Zealand, and gratefully accepted by the Mother
Country. South Africa’s help was not less valuable, for
the Union Government undertook to conquer the German
colonies on the East and the West.</p>

<p class='c013'>About the middle of October, quite a little army came
from Canada: horse, foot, gunners, sappers, all fully
equipped. These splendid fellows are used to roughing
it, and have their wits sharpened by Colonial life. They
brought a great many pets and mascots—dogs, goats,
birds, and so on—but the strangest of all was a little
boy! He had been a paper boy, and he was so eager to
come with the Canadians that one regiment smuggled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>him into their ship. By the time they landed in England
the little chap had blossomed into a bugler!</p>

<p class='c013'>I must tell you about the song sung by the Canadian
cavalry contingent composed of British Columbian Rough
Riders, as they rode through their beautiful country to
the sea. This song soon became extraordinarily popular.
Here are two verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“British Columbia Horse are we,</div>
      <div class='line'>From Canada’s Pacific Sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make the Kaiser understand</div>
      <div class='line'>He must respect our Motherland.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We’ll make him bow and scrape to us</div>
      <div class='line'>For stirring up this horrid fuss;</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll make him dance the Highland Fling</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘Rule Britannia’ loudly sing!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>These lines may not be very fine poetry, but they
have the merit of letting us know exactly how those who
sing them feel about this war.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course it took some time for the whole British
Empire to get to work, but it was clear from the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>beginning that the German hopes of trouble were absurd.
I cannot help picturing to myself with some amusement
what a shock it must have been to the Kaiser and
his advisers when they began to understand what a blunder
they had made. Instead of breaking up the British
Empire, they had actually succeeded in drawing it closer
together and making it very much stronger.</p>

<p class='c013'>At home also you remember how the outbreak of
war seemed to bring us all nearer together, rich and
poor alike.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Kitchener became Minister of War, and in response
to his appeal hundreds of thousands of fine
young men hastened to enlist. Party quarrels stopped
like magic, and Conservatives and Liberals and Labour
men alike joined together to do what they could to help.
The younger members of Parliament went off to join the
colours, while the older ones made speeches about the
war and took their share of the work of relieving those on
whom the war had brought much unmerited suffering.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Prince of Wales started a great fund for helping
people in distress. At the time when I write these words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>he had collected the enormous sum of nearly four millions.
The Prince also joined the Grenadier Guards as a
subaltern and trained with great enthusiasm. To his bitter
disappointment Lord Kitchener did not consider him
experienced enough to go to the front yet awhile.</p>

<p class='c013'>King George was unwearied in visiting his troops
in camp, and the wounded in hospital. This in
addition to all the heavy daily work he had to do with
his Ministers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Unlike the Kaiser, our King did not boast and rush
about making silly speeches. He just set to work and did
his duty like the modest gentleman that he is, and the
example of coolness and courage that he showed was an
inspiration to the whole Empire.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among all the people who helped on the outbreak
of war, I do not think any did better than the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p class='c011'>They did excellent work, especially in guarding railways
and bridges, and about this I heard at the time an
amusing story.</p>

<p class='c013'>A man who was certainly old enough to know better
resolved to play a practical joke on some Boy Scouts who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>were guarding an important railway bridge. Taking a
little bag with him, he crept stealthily along the line.
Soon the Scouts challenged him, and then this foolish
man pretended to be a German! “Ach!” he cried,
trying to imitate the German accent, “Liddle boys, I vill
blow up zis bridge.” Here the Scouts interrupted him to
such purpose that he had to spend a considerable time in
hospital! There, let us hope, he repented of his silly joke.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many hundreds of Boy Scouts did regular coastguard
duty in place of the coastguards who were called away on
active service. As the weather got cold the Scouts found
themselves in urgent need of warm clothing, and Sir
Robert Baden Powell, the Chief Scout, appealed for
mittens, comforters, stockings, and so on.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here I may say that every boy and girl ought to help
in making such things. Your elders will tell you at any
time what things are particularly wanted for the soldiers
and sailors exposed to wind and rain and storm on land
and sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>An exciting story of a London boy who would not give
his side away is that of Freddy Ascher, aged sixteen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Freddy was at school near Peronne, in Belgium, when the
war broke out. One Sunday morning after church he
decided to cycle to Peronne to look for Germans, who were
said to be close by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just outside the town, two German soldiers on bicycles
suddenly pounced on him and took him into the German
lines. There he was searched, and from letters which he
had from his parents, the German officers discovered that
he was English, and of course they began questioning him
as to where he had seen the English troops, and if any
were near.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Freddy had seen some Lancers on the evening
before, but he was not going to tell the Germans, whatever
might happen to him, so he said he had no idea where
the British were. “They must be where you have come
from,” declared the German officer. But the boy stuck
to it that he had not seen them, and the officer at last
said: “We are going to keep you a week till you tell
me something.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I was a bit frightened,” said Freddy, “but
I had resolved that I would never give away the English.
They gave me a meal, and after two hours we started on
the march. I had to walk between two German soldiers,
and was told that if I ran away I should be shot. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>end of three days we got close to Mons. I had often cycled
over the roads we went, and knew the country well. I
was again questioned by officers as to where I had seen
British troops, but I still said I had never seen any. And
then an officer said: ‘We are going to let you go, but you
must not come back through German lines.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>They gave him back his bicycle, and two German
soldiers took him a mile, and then told him to ride off.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>On Sunday, August 23, 1914, there was fought
what will rank as one of the great Battles of the
Ages. For on that Sunday the whole flower of
the German Army, including the pick of their famous
cavalry, was hurled against the British Army in the proportion
of six to one!</p>

<p class='c013'>I had hoped not to sully with the Kaiser’s now
notorious address to his troops the pages of a book in
which were to be recorded only gallant deeds. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>alone it explains the strong preponderance of numbers at
the Battle of Mons.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is what the German Emperor evidently thought
to be an inspiring and dignified message to his generals.
I must tell you it was issued on August 19, that
is, only four days before our first contact with the
enemy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is my Royal and Imperial command that you concentrate
your energies, for the immediate present, upon
one single purpose, and that is that you address all your
skill and all the valour of my soldiers to exterminate first
the treacherous English and walk over General French’s
contemptible little army.”</p>

<p class='c013'>How hard the Kaiser’s legions tried to obey his commands
you will shortly see. Also how completely they
failed, and that although, as I must again remind you, the
great outstanding feature of the Battle of Mons was the
overwhelming number of the enemy compared to our
forces.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simplest and most homely account often brings a
fact more truly home to us than any fine language would
do, and I doubt if we shall ever read a more vivid picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of the opening of this terrific fight than the following
passage in a letter written by a young British soldier to
his father, who is a gardener: “You complained last
summer, Dad, of the swarm of wasps that destroyed your
fruit. That will give you an idea of how the Germans
came for us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet another who took part in this terrific battle, wrote:
“It looked as if we were going to be snowed under!
The mass of men who came on was an avalanche, and
everyone of us must have been trodden to death, if not
killed by shells or bullets, had not our infantry charged
into them on the left wing, not 500 yards from the trench
I was in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A non-commissioned officer also shows how our side
was outnumbered: “No regiment ever fought harder
than we did, and no regiment has ever had better officers;
they went shoulder to shoulder with their men. But you
cannot expect impossibilities, no matter how brave the
boys are, when one is fighting forces twenty to thirty
times as strong.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Everyone of the great battles in the world’s history
has some outstanding heroic action to its credit. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>heroes of Mons were British cavalry, for the 9th Lancers
made there a charge every whit as gallant and glorious as
the famous Charge of the Light Brigade.</p>

<p class='c011'>A German battery of ten guns had been posted inside
a wood, each gun having been skilfully made to look like
a small haystack, which caused the British to approach
them unsuspectingly. When the guns opened fire, terrible
havoc was caused in our ranks, and it seemed impossible
to silence them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was then that the 9th Lancers made their splendid
charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole regiment rode straight at the German
battery, cut down all the gunners, and put the guns out
of action. As was the case in the Charge of the Light
Brigade they lost more men as they rode back than on
their way in.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think the best account of this wonderful cavalry
charge was written by one who was wounded in it. “We
were flying at one another as hard as the horses could go.
It was a charge such as you see in a picture, every man
hoping he would not get his knees crushed by the fellows
on each side of him.” Does not that remind you of Sir
Walter Scott’s splendid lines?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“On came the whirlwind—like the last</div>
      <div class='line'>But fiercest sweep of tempest blast;</div>
      <div class='line'>On came the whirlwind—steel gleams broke</div>
      <div class='line'>Like lightning through the rolling smoke,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The war was waked anew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There were at least two Frenchmen in this historic
charge. The Vicomte de Vauvineux, a French cavalry
officer, who rode with the brigade as interpreter, was killed
instantly—a gallant officer whose death many in England
mourned. Captain Letourey, the French master at Blundell’s
School in Devon, rode by the side of de Vauvineux,
but escaped death as by a miracle. His horse was shot
under him, but he caught another, riderless, and rode
off unscathed.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the bulk of the brigade swerved to the right,
riding for a hundred yards across the face of the machine
guns, a few rode desperately on, bearing charmed lives.
But only for a few yards. The trap, baited by the desultory
fire of the artillery, was complete. Wire entanglements
were buried in the grass thirty yards in front of the
guns. Riding full tilt into these, the few who kept their
line to the guns fell, and were made prisoners.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the 9th Lancers, not more than forty gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that night in a village hard by. Others came in next day,
and finally some two hundred and twenty in all mustered
out of the entire regiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trooper of the 9th Lancers in writing home mentioned
a fact which I thought very touching, and the admission
of which showed that he was really a brave man. He
said that when going into action he found himself crying
out “Mother!” “Mother!” and then suddenly he felt
courage, as he strikingly put it, “loom” up in him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think, without boasting, we may say that it is characteristic
of both armies that whereas the German soldiers
are played into action by a band, the British march into
action singing. During the present campaign they seem
to have preferred “It’s a long way to Tipperary,” and it
is on record that an Irish regiment sang that stirring old
song “God save Ireland.” The Manchester Regiment
sing “Killaloe,” the Rifle Brigade are fond of that fine
old ballad “Colonel Coote Manningham’s a very good
man.” The Fusiliers have their own song, “Fighting
with the Royal Fusiliers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We must not allow ourselves to forget that other
regiments of our cavalry were also engaged in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>great battle, among them the 18th Hussars and the
4th Dragoons, who performed noble feats of valour and
suffered severely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another historic “scrap” was that between a regiment
of Irish infantry and three regiments of German cavalry
splendidly horsed, equipped, and armed. The Irishmen,
who had been joking and smoking, rose up to meet the
oncoming rush of horsemen, and one who was there
said they looked like a bristling bulwark of giants, holding
weapons of steel in steel grips.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few minutes there was an awful chaos of horses,
soldiers grey and soldiers yellow, glittering lances and
bayonets, the automatic spit of machine guns, the flashes
of musketry. Amidst it all the men in khaki stood steadfast.
Grimly and without budging they threw back, at
the bayonet’s point, in utter demoralisation, the cavalry
of the Kaiser. While they fought they sang “God save
Ireland,” and “Whistle to me, said I.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Martial songs have always had a very great effect on
armies taking the field. The British have a great many
battle songs. The French have only the “<span lang="fr">Marseillaise</span>.”
The most famous German battle songs are “<span lang="de">Deutschland,
Deutschland über Alles</span>,” and “<span lang="de">Die Wacht am Rhein</span>.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The marching song of the troops who fought under
Marlborough was “Lillibullero.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the American Civil War there were many splendid
songs sung by the men going into action, of which
perhaps the best known is “John Brown’s body lies
a’mouldering in the grave.” It is probable that nowadays,
invoking the shade of Lincoln, Americans would swing into
battle singing “We are coming, Father Abraham.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a touching story to the effect that on one
occasion when the two great opposing armies—the strenuous
North and the chivalrous South—were actually only
separated by a river, the soldiers on one side began singing
“Annie Laurie,” and suddenly the refrain was heard
floating over from the other side. Long after the deadly
conflict which took place the next day was forgotten,
the incident of the song was remembered in both Northern
and Southern homes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The instinctive fear felt and shown by the Germans
of our cavalry, and the great deeds of valour performed
by them in the Battle of Mons, recalls an exciting incident
which occurred in the Indian Mutiny, when what was
known as the Volunteer Cavalry, raised by Sir Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Lawrence from among the unattached officers and civilians
of Lucknow, did a marvellous feat of arms while on their
way to that beleaguered city.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a moment when Lawrence saw himself
in danger of being surrounded. He gave the order to
retreat, a retreat which soon degenerated into a rout. On
approaching the Kokral stream which ran across the road
to Lucknow, about four hundred rebel cavalry were seen
prepared to dispute the passage of the one bridge on which
depended the safety of the fugitives. The situation was
saved by the Volunteer Cavalry. Without a moment’s
hesitation some thirty of them with their commander,
Captain Radcliffe, at their head, hurled themselves at the
dense mass in their front, and before they could strike a
blow the enemy broke and fled, leaving the bridge free.
To this splendid charge alone was due the fact that a
remnant of the British force finally reached Lucknow in
safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let me recall in the same connection another tale of
the Mutiny. It was during the night of the 19th of June,
when an especially determined attack was made on the
British position outside Delhi. Hope Grant, in command
of the cavalry, kept back the fiercest attacks of the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>on the rear of the British camp. At last, unhorsed,
surrounded by the foe, he must have fallen, had not his
sowar, or native orderly, Rooper Khan, ridden up to him
saying, “Take my horse, sir, it is your only chance of
safety!” Hope Grant refused, but taking a firm grip of
the animal’s tail he was dragged by his sowar out of the
mass of fighting men.</p>

<p class='c013'>The British cavalry have been celebrated from the days
of Julius Cæsar. In his famous Commentaries, Cæsar
remarks of his brave British foes, “They display in battle
the speed of horse with the firmness of infantry; and by
daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that
they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place,
to check their horses at full speed and manage to turn
them in an instant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The British cavalryman regards his horse as his friend.
It is recorded that after each of the great cavalry charges
at Mons the men, though in considerable danger of being
“sniped,” went round and shot the poor wounded horses,
so that they might be at once put out of their misery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of you who have ponies of your own may like
to hear how kindly and tenderly our battle-horses are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>treated. The Army Veterinary Corps, officered by fully
trained veterinary surgeons, always accompanies our
troops in the field. Immediately after an engagement
these officers attend to those horses which are only slightly
wounded, and send them along to a horse hospital if it
be necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to what care horses should have on active service,
opinions differ curiously. In a letter written by the Duke
of Wellington to a cavalry officer, he begged him when in
the field not to allow his men to dress their horses’ skins.
“You have no conception how much warmth the animals
derive from the dust which accumulates in their coats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Cavalry horses love the stir and din, even perhaps the
danger, of battle. The story goes that one day a milkwoman
passing in her cart near where a regiment of cavalry
was manœuvring, heard the trumpets sound. Her horse
pricked up his ears and started off at full gallop towards
the sentries, dragging the cart after it in spite of the poor
woman’s efforts. It did not stop till it had joined the
ranks!</p>

<p class='c013'>We will now go back to the Battle of Mons—to the
firing line, and to a remarkable act of gallantry performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>by Captain Grenfell. The tale, as told by a corporal,
cannot be improved on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gunners had all been killed by shrapnel, and
there were the guns with no one to look after them, and
a good chance that the Germans might get them. The
horses were safe enough, but there was no one to harness
them. Captain Grenfell stepped out. ‘We’ve got to get
those guns back,’ he said. ‘Who’s going to volunteer
for the job?’ He had a couple of dozen of us before he
had finished speaking. Since our chaps have seen him in
the firing line, they would go anywhere with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we went out. There were bullets flying all
round us and shrapnel bursting all over the place, but
Captain Grenfell was as cool as if he was on parade.
‘It’s all right,’ he said. ‘They can’t hit us. Come
along!’ We got to the guns all right, hitched up the
horses, and brought them back, and only three of our
chaps were hit. It’s a wonder the whole lot of us were
not wiped out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was later in that same day that this gallant Captain
Grenfell was wounded. He got a bullet in the thigh,
and a couple of his fingers were hurt. His men brought
him back from the firing line and sent for an ambulance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to take him away, but while they were waiting for the
ambulance a motor-car came along. “That’s exactly
what I want,” said the Captain. “What’s the use of an
ambulance to me? Take me back to the firing line.”
And he got into the motor-car and went back, leaving
the doctors to make what they liked of it!</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is another story, of which the hero this time is
a cavalry sergeant. This man had been badly wounded
three times, but was still going on fighting. Suddenly
he heard a corporal shouting to be taken out of the line.
Turning round, he bound up his comrade’s wounds, set
him on his own horse and sent him back out of the way.
Then, regardless of his own condition, he limped along
to his regiment, and started fighting again.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now for a very pathetic little incident.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the middle of the battle, in a beautiful cornfield
from which the men fighting could see all over the country,
one of the drivers of a battery was badly wounded. He
asked to see the colours before he died. His officer told
him that the guns were <em>his</em> colours, and he answered:
“Yes, that is true. Tell the drivers to keep their eyes
on their guns, for if we lose our guns we lose our colours.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>These brave drivers have the strongest feeling of
affection and loyalty for their guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>On one occasion, also at Mons, two drivers brought
a gun out of action, the shells bursting all round them.
They had noticed that the gunners had all been killed,
so they walked their horses down to save the gun. One
driver held the horses under a fearful fire while the other
“limbered up.” The gun was rushed safely back, neither
men nor horses being hit. Their comrades, watching
them from the trenches, thought it quite impossible for
them to escape death, for shot and shell were ploughing
the ground up all round them.</p>

<p class='c013'>So many were the brave, chivalrous, and merciful
deeds in this battle that it is difficult to make a choice.
I should like, however, to tell you of one such performed
by a lieutenant of the “A” Company of the 1st Cheshires,
whose nickname is “Winkpop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was shot through his right leg, and on the road
some of his men cut off his boots and tried to bandage his
wounds. As he rose to his feet, he saw a private in distress
about fifteen yards away. Seizing a rifle he hobbled
forward and managed to bring him in on his back under
a murderous fire from the enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>This gallant deed recalls a splendid act of valour
performed by two non-commissioned officers, who were
among the first group of V.C. heroes. They were among
the very few to return unscathed from the Charge of the
Light Brigade. Regardless of their own danger, they
remained by one of their wounded officers, and at last,
by making a bandy-chair with their arms, they actually
brought him in safety to the British lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cool courage of the doctors and of the ambulance
men whose duty it is to rescue and then to attend to the
wounded must never be lost sight of in what may be called
the more showy deeds performed by our soldiers and
sailors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story you have just read recalls the astonishing
coolness and bravery of the man who, I believe, was the
first doctor to receive the V.C.—Surgeon Mouat of the
Inniskillings. He dressed the wound, under fire, of
Captain Morris, of the 17th Lancers, who had just taken
part in the Charge of the Light Brigade, thereby saving
his patient’s life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Middlesex Regiment, who bear the glorious nickname
of “The Die Hards,” greatly distinguished themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>on those eventful days, August 23 and 24. They
were much pleased by a communication received by
them, containing a statement by Mr. J. B. Dolphin,
British Vice-Consul at Liège, in which the following
passage occurred:</p>

<p class='c011'>“A German general said that he had never dreamt of
such magnificent bravery as that displayed by them. The
accuracy of their firing was a revelation: their coolness was
wonderful, and their trench work splendid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As you will see later in this book, “The Die Hards”
also distinguished themselves in one of the later battles
of the war.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the first public speech made in England by a British
officer wounded at Mons, Captain Buchanan Dunlop, he
paid a fine tribute to the French non-combatants, as
people who are not soldiers are called in a country at
war:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think England might get a very good lesson from
the inhabitants of France and Belgium. All the way as
we proceeded through that country all the inhabitants
turned out and did all they could for us. They brought
us coffee, bread and butter, cigarettes, and anything
they could think of. The ladies even turned out balls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of string in case the men might find them useful, and
handkerchiefs. We advanced up through this country,
and then had to retire through it. You can imagine
our feelings going back through the same country
that we had previously traversed. This did not make
the slightest difference to the way we were treated by
the inhabitants. They brought us coffee and other things
as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fugitives flying from their homes were eager to give
us of the food which they were carrying back for their
own consumption. What struck us the whole time was
the thought, If this was England? What an awful thing
it would be to have an invading army in England, and
everything happening here that is now going on in
France!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Buchanan Dunlop also told two splendid little
stories to show what pluck and fight our men have in
them:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was talking to an officer of my own regiment in
town yesterday. He was also wounded, and he told me
about a fight on Wednesday week when one of his men
lying just in front of him under heavy shell fire, turned
to him and said: ‘Sir, may I retire?’ ‘Why?’ asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the officer. ‘Sir,’ replied the man, ‘I have been hit three
times.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is the other little incident:</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the very first day we were holding a canal bank,
and during the night we had orders to retire, having held
off the enemy all day. We were to blow up the bridges.
By some mishap a sergeant with ten men was left on the
wrong side of that canal with the Germans about two
hundred yards in front. We could hear the Germans
talking. The next morning, when we called the roll, we
expressed sorrow at thinking that this sergeant and his
men must have been captured. But in the morning, when
they found they were cut off, what did they do? They
did not put up their hands, but blazed away at the Germans,
with the result that the Germans fled and the
sergeant and his men got away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The following story shows how many sides there are
to a modern battle.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was at Mons that a fight occurred for the possession
of a canal bridge, and a handful of British soldiers held
at bay the enemy, who were in force a hundred yards
away. The odds were overwhelmingly against our soldiers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and the Germans were preparing to rush the bridge, when
an engineer sergeant perceived that if the enemy succeeded
our men would be cut off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Urging the men to concentrate their fire on one particular
point, this cool, brave man proceeded to dynamite
the bridge. But as time was short he could only employ
a few inches of fuse. This meant that he went to certain
death. Sure enough, he and the bridge blew up together,
and as an eye-witness quaintly said, “Another Victoria
Cross was saved.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A young Isle of Wight gunner named Butchers, from
the pretty village of Brading, was the hero of a magnificent
episode.</p>

<p class='c011'>A half battery in rather an exposed position was galling
the enemy by the accuracy of its aim. Several of the
German batteries therefore made a combined attack on it.
It was a fight between a David and half-a-dozen Goliaths.
One by one its guns were silenced. The men who had
been serving them were shot down till at last only
Butchers was left. He went on doing his best, working
steadily and to all appearance calmly, till an officer
called him away.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>One of the first letters received from the fighting line
contained the following striking tribute from the writer,
a private, to one of his officers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know I have often spoken of Captain ——, and
what a fine fellow he was. There was no braver man on
the field. He got knocked over early with a piece of a
shell, which smashed his leg. He must have been in great
pain, but kneeling on one knee he was cheerful and kept
saying, ‘My bonnie boys, make sure of your man.’ When
he was taken away on the ambulance he shouted, ‘Keep
cool and mark your man.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>You have already heard how splendidly our soldiers
were welcomed by the women and children when they
landed in France. Well, during the Battle of Mons the
French peasant women showed their gratitude in an even
more practical way. It was very hot during those hours
of fierce fighting, and these valiant women brought water,
and luscious cooling fruit, right into our trenches and firing
line. “I can assure you they are the bravest souls I have
ever met,” wrote a British private to his mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the Battle of Mons the Germans may be credited
with having performed at least one act of kindness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Lieutenant Irwin, of the South Lancashire Regiment,
was wounded by shrapnel at the end of the day’s hard
fighting. He lay all night in a turnip field. In the morning
some German soldiers discovered him and one of
them brought a bundle of hay for Mr. Irwin to lie on
till the stretcher came up. He was taken to Valenciennes,
and the German commander most kindly allowed him
to write home to his friends. There were many French
doctors and nurses in this hospital, and the German
officers behaved well to them also.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very different was the experience of Private Charles
Baker, of the 20th Hussars.</p>

<p class='c011'>After being wounded, he was taken into a cottage
which had been turned into a temporary hospital and
where there were already twenty men, including three
Germans, in charge of an English doctor. Suddenly
this poor little hospital was raided by a party of fifty
Germans, all more or less drunk. Roughly they ordered
the British wounded to say where their regiment was,
but, as Private Charles Baker wrote home to his people,
“Not one of us would give the game away.” Thereupon
they were threatened with death, and as Private Baker
very honestly remarks: “I can tell you I began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>shake. I was really afraid then. I thought my number
was up!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly a most unexpected thing happened. The
three wounded Germans implored their comrades to spare
the British, pointing out how very kindly they had been
treated by the English doctor. So the fifty Germans
went off as quickly as they had come in, and the next day
the wounded were all moved to another hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of you who know anything of the Crimean War
are aware what a terrific battle was Inkerman. The
British losses at Mons were the highest for any single
battle since Inkerman. On the other hand, there were
probably ten times greater forces engaged at Mons than
at Inkerman, when the numbers on either side were
fairly even.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now one last word as to where this battle was fought.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very few English people who had not actually been
there were familiar with the name of Mons, and yet the
town which gave its name to the first big battle of this
war, is not only the centre of the French “Black Country,”
but it has had a long and romantic history, and was founded
by Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>A certain King of Spain, to whom Mons once belonged,
must have been very like the Kaiser. The latter,
as we know, has with magnificent lavishness, bestowed
the Prussian V.C., the great decoration of the Iron
Cross, on some fifty thousand of his men. This King
of Spain was once so pleased with the inhabitants of
Mons that he conferred a peerage on every member of
the Town Council!</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>You will remember that the Battle of Mons was
fought on the 23rd of August, a Sunday.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Monday the whole world, with the
exception of Germany and Austria, heard with dismay
that the famous Belgian fort of Namur had fallen, after
holding out as long as it could against the great German
guns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Namur was in a sense the key to France, so you
can understand how very very serious a matter for the Allies,
as the French and British forces were henceforth to be
called, was the fall of this great fortress. In these days
it is rather curious to remember that fourteen British
regiments, including the Grenadier Guards, the Scots
Guards, the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, the Coldstreams, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Royal Irish, and the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, bear
the honorary distinction, “Namur, 1695,” upon their
colours, for having captured this stronghold two hundred
and nineteen years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the town of Namur flows the Meuse, a lovely
river, shared by France and Belgium, which has already
seen some of the hardest fighting of this war.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the banks of the Meuse, Joan of Arc, as a little girl,
must often have played, for in France it laves the village
of Domrémy. When it reaches Belgium, this storied river
flows by the grave of an extraordinary man who in some
ways had certain affinities with Joan of Arc—I mean Peter
the Hermit, who is buried in the gardens of the old Abbey
of Neufmoustier.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most beautiful description of the Meuse at Namur
was written by William Wordsworth:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Is this the stream whose cities, heights, and plains,</div>
      <div class='line'>War’s favourite playground are, with crimson stains</div>
      <div class='line'>Familiar as the morn with pearly dews?</div>
      <div class='line'>The morn, that now, along the silver Meuse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spreading her peaceful ensigns, calls the swains</div>
      <div class='line'>To tend their silent boats and ringing wains,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Or strip the bough whose mellow fruit bestrews</div>
      <div class='line'>The ripening corn beneath it. As mine eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn from the fortified and threatening hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>How sweet the prospect of yon watery glade,</div>
      <div class='line'>With its grey rocks clustering in pensive shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, shaped like old monastic turrets, rise</div>
      <div class='line'>From the smooth meadow-ground serene and still!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Terrible fighting took place over that “smooth
meadow-ground,” and at last the fortress surrendered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now let me tell you something of a happy and inspiriting
nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Namur was falling, the gallant little French
fortress of Longwy was holding out against the Germans,
and that though it was what is now called a fortress of
the second class.</p>

<p class='c011'>Longwy has always been regarded as of considerable
importance, owing to its position on the Franco-German
frontier. In the middle of the Great Revolution it was
taken by Germans, and its fall very much upset the
citizens of Paris. It put up a splendid fight in 1815, and
was then besieged for three full months before it fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Franco-Prussian War it resisted for one week.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>But in this war it held out, against infinitely greater
numbers and far more formidable siege artillery than in
1870, for twenty-four days! The enemy congratulated
the French officer who had conducted the defence on
his bravery and skill.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fall of Namur forced the Allies back, and it was
then that there began the British rearguard movement
which was so brilliantly, skilfully, and successfully conducted
by Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien that it is considered
worthy to rank with the great retreat of Sir John Moore
at Corunna.</p>

<p class='c013'>I should like here to tell you something of the
soldier to whom Sir John French paid a grand tribute in
his official despatches concerning those first momentous
days of the War.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien is a younger son
of a family which has given many distinguished soldiers
to the Empire, and for generations has held feudal
sway over the Scilly Isles. Those of you who know
Cornwall may have visited the beautiful tropical gardens
surrounding his old home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he obtained his high command in the Expeditionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Force, Smith-Dorrien had seen a great deal of
fighting, and one likes to quote now what he once said
during the South African War:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me a thousand Colonials, men well acquainted
with the rifle and expert in horsemanship; let me train
them for six months; and I shall then be ready to lead
them against an equal number of men drawn from any
Continental army with absolute confidence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Horace has also had experience with another type
of splendid soldier of the Empire; for at one time he commanded
the 4th Infantry Division of the Indian Army,
which includes some of the finest troops in the native
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the South African War, Smith-Dorrien performed
one of the pluckiest deeds ever done by a British
officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>His brigade was moving forward to take a main Boer
position, when two battalions, one of the Gordons and
the other of the C.I.V.’s, lost touch. The Gordons, to put
it shortly, rushed up the hill at Doornkop with such
impetuosity that they got cut off, and the General saw
that there was great danger of their being surrounded.
Without wasting a moment, and under an awful fire which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>was being kept up by an invisible foe, he galloped
straight across the enemy’s front and turned the Highlanders
back.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Smith-Dorrien rode in unscathed, a brother
officer protested against the awful risk he had run. “Someone
had to stop the Gordons! I couldn’t send anyone
else to face that fire, could I?” was his only answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It must have been hard for so brave a man to have to
organise a retreat, but he knew that it had to be done—and
done fighting.</p>

<p class='c013'>You will have heard of—you may even have known—someone
whose name was included in the list sent
home after a battle as “missing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now there is something terrible and disturbing in
the thought of a man being missing. It makes one feel
that anything may have happened to him. But we must
always remember that this disturbing word does not
necessarily mean that any harm has come to the soldier
in question, still less that he is killed. It very often means
that he did not hear the order to retreat and so was left
behind in the trenches to be taken prisoner by the enemy.
Not a pleasant fate, but from the point of view of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>who love him, better than if he had fallen, as the French
proudly put it, on the Field of Honour. Also it is well
to remember that the number of the missing, especially
in what is called a rearguard action, is always greater
than the number of killed or wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>A retreat has been well described as disheartening and
painful, but in strategy it is an operation like any other.
Very often, as in the case of Smith-Dorrien, it is the way
to win in the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>What is strategy? Strategy is another name for
arranging your forces like chessmen on a chess-board with
the object of winning in the end. Great strategists are
born, not made. Cæsar was a great strategist, so was
Napoleon, and so was Lord Roberts. Just as a composer
can write a piece of music without the help of a
piano or any other instrument, so the born strategist can
work out the plan of a battle, and even make a shrewd
guess as to who is going to win, when sitting in his study
with a good map before him.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may interest you to know that before each of his
great battles Napoleon spent the night in his tent studying
a number of large maps laid out on the floor. Lying flat on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>his stomach, and with a little stick in his hand, he would
work out the dispositions of his troops and of the enemy.
When he had made up his mind what was going to happen,
down to every detail, he would call in his generals and
explain to each of them exactly what he was to do the
next day. His generals soon found that though he was
not always certain what his own side would do, he
could always foresee the plans of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have already spoken of Sir John Moore at Corunna.
At the time that great soldier made his famous retreat, he
was much criticised, but now all military historians regard
it as having been a most wonderful piece of work, if only
because it forced Napoleon to alter his whole plan of
campaign.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as General von Kluck wished to obey the Kaiser
and destroy the British Army, so Napoleon was most eager
to destroy Sir John Moore’s forces. Fresh from a series
of brilliant victories, at the head of a splendid host,
Napoleon dashed into Spain, but Sir John Moore, by his
masterly retreat, defeated all his plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first of his contemporaries to realise the splendid
thing Moore had done was Napoleon himself. While the
British commanders—Moore’s own contemporaries and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>even his own friends—were criticising the dead man, for
he fell at Corunna, Napoleon was putting on record his
unbounded admiration of his foe.</p>

<p class='c013'>How our gallant soldiers felt when ordered to fall
back was graphically described by Private Harman, of
the King’s Royal Rifles:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We did not like the order to retire, for we knew we
were doing better than the Germans, and inflicting heavy
losses upon them. Our officers also knew we were disappointed.
On the fifth day of the retreat—which was
the last I was in before being knocked out—our commanding
officer came round and spoke to us, saying, ‘Stick it,
boys, stick it! To-morrow we shall go the other way and
advance.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>And in time, as we shall see, they did advance, but
before that glad moment came they had to retreat, fighting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Listen to this, written by another private:</p>

<p class='c011'>“On one occasion seven of us were left to cover a
Maxim gun while it was being limbered up to take some
other position farther back. We had to take up the
position of the gun, and we kept firing rapid so as to make
it appear that the Maxim gun was still there. The Germans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>were shelling the position on both sides of us. Then
we had to go at the double for about five miles to catch
up to the others. It was a hard jog-trot all the way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was during this skilful retreat that there came the
first of those wonderful duels in the air which established,
as Sir John French so well put it, the personal supremacy
of our flying men, and proved that they are quicker and
sharper in the air than those of the enemy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our man got above the German, who tried his
hardest to escape,” wrote an eye-witness. “The Englishman
was firing his revolver, and the German seemed to
plane down in good order, but when he got to the ground
he was dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Little by little, in some cases not for many weeks,
came through stories of the daring and quenchless heroism
which illumined the dark night of the great retreat.</p>

<p class='c011'>A solitary grave, each day strewn with fresh flowers,
is the last resting-place of an English soldier who, quite
alone, fought his last fight till overwhelmed by numbers.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the first rearguard action he had strayed from
his comrades, and fallen exhausted from fatigue. Unable
to find them, he took up his quarters in a deserted carriage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Thirty-six hours later the Germans appeared and fired at
him. Undeterred by the fact that he was utterly alone,
he replied, and such was his determination and accuracy
of aim that he accounted for six German officers, one of
them a general, before he fell under a volley.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French from a village near by buried him where
he had fought, erected a cross, and in honour of his gallantry,
laid fresh flowers each day on his grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>His name was David M. Kay, and he belonged to the
5th Lancers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearken to another exploit, of which the hero was
Corporal Shaw, who for three years was the twelve-stone
wrestling champion of the Army in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw a comrade in difficulty with his horse in the
first retirement from Mons. The pack had slipped round
to its side, and the rider was endeavouring to straighten
it. Shaw dashed up and helped the soldier to straighten
the pack. Bullets rained round the plucky champion,
one darted into the soft part of his shoulder, another
killed one of his comrades near by, but the man he was
helping rode off clear.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The first place to which our troops fell back
(fighting hard all the way) was Cambrai, where
cambric was first made, and where, in days of
peace, much exquisitely fine linen is still woven. Cambrai
and Le Cateau are practically one, and a very fierce engagement
took place there.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Here I must tell you of a brave Englishwoman who
had lived for fifteen years at Le Cateau. She kept a little
restaurant, and during these terrible hours when such
hard fighting was going on close to the town she went on
cooking eggs and bacon for her fellow-countrymen. Both
her French friends and the English soldiers begged her to
leave the town, but, as only answer, she observed that
she wouldn’t move “for all the Germans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be hoped that her little house was saved, but
the English soldier, who told the story of her pluck, fears
that it must have been destroyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the Battle of Cambrai, the charge of the 12th Lancers
and Royal Scots Greys is said to have been the equal of
anything seen at Waterloo. Indeed finer; for at Waterloo,
in one cavalry charge at any rate, the men, after their first
success, got out of hand, went too far, and suffered grievously
in consequence.</p>

<p class='c013'>An heroic passage of arms, in which the 2nd Battalion
Connaught Rangers were concerned, was splendidly described
by a private in a letter home:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was understood we were to pass the night at
Cambrai, but we got a report that the Germans were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>approaching, and were close on us. Every man was called
to stand to arms, and soon the German shells were falling
amongst us. Our colonel was a perfect gentleman, and
under his gallant lead the Rangers set a bold front. In
the midst of the bursting of the German projectiles his
clear, stentorian voice rang out: ‘Rangers of Connaught,
all eyes are upon you to-night. While you have fists and
a heart within you, charge them. If you don’t, never face
me in this world nor in the next!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our boys were greatly encouraged by the bravery
shown by Colonel Abercrombie. Bayonets were fixed,
but at the sight of the steel the enemy turned about. We
were, however, completely outnumbered, and in a subsequent
attack some of our men, including our brave
commander, were taken prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It must have been that same night that a brave
deed was done for which the hero, had he survived, would
surely have been awarded the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p class='c011'>The British took the offensive against the Germans
who were holding a bridge spanning a canal. It was very
dark, and when our men reached an embankment running
sharply down to the river, several failed to secure a foothold,
and fell into the water.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Four of the men, who were unable to swim, were in
imminent danger of drowning, when Corporal Brindall,
an excellent swimmer, plunged into the river and rescued
all four in turn. He was clambering up the embankment
himself, when a German shell exploded near him, killing
him instantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in the stir and din of battle funny and curious
little incidents are always taking place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Take the odd case of Private Joseph Davis, of the
Dorset Regiment, a well-known footballer, who, at Cambrai,
received a shrapnel bullet in the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, strange to say, Mr. Davis has tattooed on his chest
a gorgeous portrait of Queen Victoria. While he lay
wounded on the field of battle, his one dread was that the
Germans would see his chest and want to have a dig at the
Queen! Happily his fears were not realised.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was at Cambrai also that another amusing and most
unexpected little incident took place.</p>

<p class='c011'>An English governess who happened to be spending
a holiday in a village on the route of our Army rushed
for protection to the British lines during a skirmish.
For four days she remained with the troops, marching,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>bivouacking, and sheltering during fights, until she was
placed on a conveyance which ensured her safe passage
to a port.</p>

<p class='c011'>During her enforced visit to our gallant troops, she
was continually exposed to danger, but she maintained an
iron indifference to the inconveniences of her situation,
and the soldiers met with such good luck in those four
days that they came to regard the lady as a mascot, and
were genuinely sorry when she departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>A terrible toll of death was exacted during this awful
battle, and as at the Battle of Mons, so many were the
gallant and noble deeds that it is difficult to make a choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>To Lieutenant Noel, a young officer killed in action,
the following moving tribute was paid:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Always cheerful, ever thoughtful for others, the
best of companions with the kindest of hearts, Jack Noel
endeared himself to all who knew him, and those who were
privileged to be called his friends were bound to him by
ties far stronger than those of common friendship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His death was a singularly heroic one, and in wonderful
keeping with what we know of his life. A wounded
corporal of his regiment, who was near him when he fell,
says that “Lieutenant Noel, despite the fact that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>hit in or near his left eye by a shot that broke the half of
his field-glasses, promptly picked up his glasses again, and,
finding the right half of them still workable, continued to
direct the fire of his platoon with his right eye, until a few
minutes later he was killed by a shot in his left temple.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Not the British only fought at Cambrai; deeds of
unparalleled valour were done by the French, and also
by France’s Arab troops, the Turcos. It was at Cambrai
that the Turcos first saw fire. They were singled out,
five hundred of them, to do a desperate piece of work on
which the fate of thousands of men depended.</p>

<p class='c011'>Straining as if at a leash, they waited for the order to
advance. At last it came. They swung round and faced
the foe. Onward they went, right up to the guns, and
against what seemed to be an impregnable line of trenches.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the five hundred, only twelve survived; of the
twelve, only one was unwounded. But the enemy’s
guns were silenced, and the Germans had fled from their
trenches. The men who fell were buried shoulder to
shoulder as they fought.</p>

<p class='c013'>The French peasant women, as we have seen, are
wonderfully brave in the matter of going under fire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>One of these showed herself possessed of a quieter type
of courage, but courage nevertheless, during the retreat.
Hear the tale as told by a British officer:</p>

<p class='c011'>“After the Battle of Mons we were billeted at a large
farmhouse, the occupants of which did not seem very
pleased to see us. We had not touched any eatables for
several hours, and I made the housewife understand that
we wanted some food. She looked at us in a way which
was not altogether an expression of friendliness, and,
pointing at the table, round which a number of workingmen
were gathered, to whom she was serving their meals,
she said, ‘Après les ouvriers.’—‘After my work-people.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“We waited patiently till the men had finished their
meal, and then asked once more for food. But the woman
merely remarked, ‘Après nous.’ ‘After us.’ And she
and her husband subsequently prepared to eat their supper.
It is rather trying to see somebody making an attack on a
hearty meal while one has not tasted any food for a long
time. So I demanded, in the name of the King, that we
should be supplied with foodstuff immediately, the more
so that the woman seemed so unwilling to grant our
wishes. The only answer she made was that, if we were
in want of food, we should have to look for it ourselves
and try to prepare it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“The situation was rather awkward, and I was wondering
why these French peasantry were so extremely unkind
towards British soldiers!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suddenly it entered my mind that perhaps she
thought we were Germans! At the same time I had
something like a happy thought in order to prove that we
were not. One of our men, a tall, heavy chap, who was
still outside the house, was ordered to substitute a German
helmet for his own cap, and to knock at the door. He
did, the door was opened, we dashed forward, and made
‘the German’ a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The whole scene changed all of a sudden. The
whole family embraced us, almost choked us. Food and
wine and dainties were supplied at once, and we had a
most glorious time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>August 26, a Wednesday, saw perhaps the fiercest
hand-to-hand fighting which had yet taken place. All
day our gallant men fought at Landrécies against fearful
odds. There two companies of the Coldstream Guards
held 3000 Germans at bay for four hours. Lieut. Percy
Wyndham (a direct descendant of the great Irish rebel-hero,
Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and of his wife, the lovely
Frenchwoman who lives in romance under the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Pamela) stood up and fired a hundred rounds from his
revolver so that his men could form up quietly behind
him. He then shouted out to them: “Fall in, and die
like Coldstreams!” This gallant young soldier fell in
action a week later at Soissons.</p>

<p class='c013'>Listen to the heroic end of yet another officer of the
Coldstreams. Lieutenant Allan William George Campbell
lost his life through a successful attempt to rescue a comrade
who was in a worse plight than himself. He had
already been wounded, when he noticed Captain Tollemache
fall. Together with Colonel Ponsonby he went out
and carried Captain Tollemache over a mile under fire
to a position of safety; but while he was doing so, he
was again terribly wounded, and he only lived a few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>We get a touching glimpse of Lieut. G. C. Wynn,
killed in action at Landrécies, in a letter from one of Mr.
Wynn’s men, written to the young officer’s father:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The last day he was alive we had got a cup of tea in
the trenches, and we asked him to have one. He said, ‘No,
drink it yourselves, you are in want of it’; and then with a
smile he added, ‘We have to hold the trenches to-day.’
At Mons we had been fighting all day, and someone brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>a sack of pears and two loaves of bread. Lieut. Wynn
accepted only one pear and a very little bread. We noticed
this. I had a small bottle of pickles in my haversack and
asked him to have some. But it was the usual answer,
‘You require them yourself!’ He died doing his duty
like the officer and gentleman he was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a letter written from hospital after this engagement,
a corporal told of how he had been saved from a
lingering death on the field:</p>

<p class='c011'>“They blazed at us from 350 yards, and as fast as we
shot one lot down, another came up. At last I got a bit
of shell in the calf of my leg. We retired all together.
My captain put me on his horse and led it for miles, until
we got to a train.”</p>

<p class='c013'>St. Quentin, with which will ever be associated the
name of a terrible battle, one of the three rearguard
actions in which our army fought with such splendid
bravery and against such fearful odds, is a beautiful old
town. It was part of the dowry of Mary Queen of Scots,
and all through her long, sad captivity, she still received
money from the faithful city.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long before this great war, St. Quentin saw terrific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>fighting. Spaniards, British, Germans and Flemings there
defeated the French, who were led by the brave Coligny
and the famous Constable Montmorency. That old
Battle of St. Quentin was fought on St. Lawrence’s Day,
and it was because he believed that God had helped him
to win this victory that the sinister King of Spain, Philip
II, built the Escurial, a marvellous Spanish palace formed
in the shape of a gridiron.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great charge of the Black Watch took place at
St. Quentin. The men had marched close on eighty
miles before word ran through the ranks they were
going into action. Unmeasured was their joy! At
once they put themselves in good skirmishing order,
and, under cover of the guns, got closer and closer
to the enemy. Not till they were within a hundred
yards of the German lines did they receive the longed
for command.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Black Watch and the Scots Greys charged together.
The Scots Greys galloped forward, the Black Watch hanging
to their stirrups. On the horses flew through a cloud
of bullets, but every sound was drowned by the thunder
of the horses’ hoofs as they careered wildly on. Saddles
emptied quickly as the charge closed on the German lines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>and man and horse were on the German gunners before
they knew where they were. Down the enemy went in
hundreds, and still the deadly work of the bayonet continued.
Soon the Germans broke and fled “like rabbits
before the shot of a gun.” It is said that there were 2000
British against 20,000 Germans. Close on 4000 prisoners
were taken, as well as an immense number of guns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many years ago a famous historian of the Scottish
Highlands wrote concerning the Highlander words which
hold as good to-day as they did in the ’45. “He is taught
to consider courage as the most honourable virtue, cowardice
the most disgraceful failing; to venerate and obey
his chief, and to devote himself to his native country and
clan; thus prepared to be a soldier, he is ready to follow
wherever honour and duty call him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a fine little story concerning the men of the
Black Watch on their first visit to England. The then
King had never seen a Highlander at close quarters, and
as he wished to do so, three men who were noted for their
dexterity in the broad-sword exercise and with the lochaber
axe were sent to St. James’s Palace. So pleased was the
King with their performance that he gave them each a
guinea, which they in turn gave to the porter of the gate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>as they went out. “Doubtless,” they observed, “the
King has mistaken our character and condition in our
own country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is interesting to note that it was the gallantry
of the Highlanders in covering the retreat of the Allied
Forces at Fontenoy which received the special praise of
the Commander-in-Chief. Fontenoy was their maiden
experience of a foreign foe.</p>

<p class='c013'>I want you specially to remember what our soldiers
in this war have owed to what is called the Army Service
Corps. You will recollect my telling you that Napoleon
said an army marched on its stomach. All that is necessary
for the physical well-being of our men is done quickly,
quietly, and very bravely, by the officers and men of the
Army Service Corps. Their adventures are often as
perilous and exciting as those which befall the fighting
soldier. They all have to bear the weight of considerable
responsibility and ever-present anxiety. The enemy
always does his best to harass, intercept, and, if possible,
destroy the food which is on its way to our men. Not
food only for the men, but forage for the horses is under
the care of this wonderful Corps.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Never was the triumph of their organisation shown to
such advantage as during the fighting retreat with which
we are now concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>On one occasion the Germans, who, remember, were
close on the heels of the British motors and waggons, were
particularly anxious to get hold of a train of forty motor
lorries stocked with food and ammunition. In addition
to these were also several hundred horsed waggons similarly
loaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, when close to St. Quentin, which was to be
the next great stand, the men in charge of this huge convoy
were informed that the Uhlans were only a mile away.
The colonel in command made certain inquiries. To
his dismay, he learnt that not only his men but their
horses also were so dead tired that they could not go on
any more. He, therefore, made up his mind to stay
in the little village where they found themselves, and if
attacked to put up a stout fight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wearied though they were, each was sent with a loaded
rifle to a place on the line he was to defend. The waggons
were all drawn up in the funny little narrow winding
streets which make a French village not unlike an old
Scottish town.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>In a very short time everything was in order to receive
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have not yet told you much of the fate of ordinary
people during a great war, but you can fancy for yourselves
how the inhabitants of this village felt when they realised
that their home was about to be made into a battle-ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wise colonel of our forces advised that all the
village people should go into the church, and there the
curé arranged to hold a service. The lady who generally
played the organ eagerly gave her services, and soon the
English soldiers guarding the convoys were heartened by
hearing the sweet singing of French and Latin hymns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time went on. The horses got very restless, and a
stampede was feared. Had that happened all would have
been lost. But it did not happen, and at last day broke.
No attack had been delivered, and it was clear that the
enemy had gone to the right or left of the village, pressing
onward in the belief that the British convoy was ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet another exciting incident, which shows the kind of
adventures the Army Service Corps takes as being all
part of its day’s work.</p>

<p class='c011'>A convoy had been drawn up some way from the firing
line, and in the early morning rations were just about to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>be issued to a brigade of artillery who were going into
action at 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, when the word went forth that the
convoy was being quietly surrounded by a troop of
German cavalry.</p>

<p class='c011'>At once it was arranged that if it could not be got
away it must be burnt. But before doing that the officers
resolved to make a push for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lorries and horses started off at top speed till they
got to a railway bridge. There all the transport, with
the exception of thirty motor lorries, passed over in safety.
Another determined effort was made, and out of the thirty,
twenty-eight got over safely. Then the bridge was blown
up. A moment later the remaining two lorries were in
the hands of the Germans, together with two officers
and eight men, who were, we may suppose, taken prisoners.</p>

<p class='c013'>A wonderful stand was also made by our retreating
troops at Tournai, when 700 British soldiers resisted
5000 Uhlans. They stood their ground to a man, till of
the 700 less than half remained. Even then there was
no panic. Calmly, harassing their pursuers with a murderous
fire, “all that was left of them” retreated
with the wounded, their convoy intact. As for the
guns, though some were lost, many more were put out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of action. The enemy showed reckless bravery, hurling
themselves on to the very muzzles of the British field guns.</p>

<p class='c013'>A soldier always admires a brave man, no matter what
his uniform is. Here is a fine tribute paid by a wounded
British artilleryman to the enemy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The grandest thing I saw out there was the fight of a
handful of good fighting men in German uniforms. These
chaps were the last of a regiment to cross a stream under
fiendish rifle and artillery fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were hotly pursued by French cavalry and infantry,
and when they saw that it was all up the remnant
made for a little hill and gathered round the regimental
flag to fight to the last. The French closed round them,
and called on them to surrender, but not they! They
stood there back to back until the last man went down
with the flag in his grasp and a dozen bullet wounds in
his body.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the flag was captured by the French, but there
was no shouting over the victory, and every soldier who
passed that way and knew the story of those brave chaps
bared his head to the memory of brave men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the last stage of the great retreat, the British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>fought splendidly at Compiègne. It was there that three
non-commissioned officers in the Royal Horse Artillery
won the V.C. in recognition of a deed of extraordinary
bravery. Taken by surprise by the enemy, the now
famous “L” battery fought their guns until only one
remained, and the three men who became the V.C.
heroes were the sole survivors of the battery working the
gun. The story may be briefly told thus:</p>

<p class='c011'>The battery was waiting for the order to retire; it was
limbered up ready to move at a moment’s notice. There
was a thick mist, and when it lifted the battery was
suddenly subjected to a terrible fire from the ridge which
they had supposed to be occupied by the French, but
which was now occupied by the Germans. The first
burst of fire killed nearly all the horses of the British
gun teams, which made it impossible to retire with the
guns, so the men, splendidly directed by their commanding
officer, Captain Bradbury, unlimbered and began to
reply to the German fire. Many of the gunners had been
killed during the first few moments. Those remaining
coolly replied with such good effect that one by one the
German guns were put out of action. So terribly outnumbered
were the British gunners that in a short time
two out of the three of their guns in action had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>silenced, and only one remained to defend the position.
Officers and men went on serving this one remaining
British gun till all were killed or wounded with the
exception of three. At last they had put all the German
guns out of action but one, and then an exciting duel
began, till at last behind the shelter of their gun the three
were found by a strong force of cavalry and infantry which
had come to their rescue.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>You all know what it is to be in a hurry. You
have all said on some occasion or other, “I
must get that done quickly or I shan’t be able
to do it at all.” It is an anxious, worrying mood. Well,
the Germans, when they started on this war, were one
and all of them in that kind of mood. They all knew,
from the Kaiser to the humblest soldier, that time was
all-important in the French campaign. I think you will
guess at once why this was so, but in case you have already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>forgotten, I may remind you that it was owing to the fact
that the Germans have to fight in this great war, which
they themselves provoked, not only the French and the
British, but also the Russians. You know that this was
their excuse for breaking their word of honour, and
rushing through Belgium. This was also the reason
why they made that astonishing, and we must admit,
that magnificent rush towards Paris during our retreat
from Mons.</p>

<p class='c011'>But all the time they were pushing forward, deep in
the heart of every German soldier there must have echoed
the dreaded tramp of the Russian legions. The poet
Marvell expressed in exquisite English exactly what the
enemy must have been feeling during the whole of the
French campaign:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But at my back I always hear</div>
      <div class='line'>Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A retreat, in ordinary language, means a falling back.
There are, however, many ways of falling back; indeed,
as in everything else, there is a right way and a wrong
way. Sir John French’s gallant army, and the French
forces under General Joffre, accomplished their retreat in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the right way. Although at the time the enemy was quite
unaware of it, everything was done according to a well-thought-out
and careful plan; and, as you have seen, while
this falling back movement was going on, our retreating
army constantly turned, harried, and even forced back the
advancing enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The object of the Germans may be told very shortly.
It was to reach Paris, to enter that great city in the guise of
conquerors, conclude a hasty peace with France, and then
rush back by train and motor lorry to fight the Russians.
It will interest you to know how and why this plan miscarried.</p>

<p class='c013'>What I am going to tell you illustrates the soundness
of the wise old saying, “Speech is silvern, silence is
golden.” Even Paris remained all unknowing of the clever
plan formed by the Allies. That great and beautiful
city believed herself to be doomed. The awful fate of
the inhabitants of Louvain was thought by many Parisians
to be the forerunner of what would happen to themselves.
The French Government, that is the President
and his Ministers, left the capital for the distant town of
Bordeaux, and orders were given that all those inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of Paris who had babies and little children should leave
the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though to the great majority of French people Paris
is in a sense the capital of the civilised world, the nation
made up its mind to sacrifice this beloved and beautiful
city if the good of the country as a whole required it.
They did not say anything of their resolve. They simply
made it, and waited grimly for the end.</p>

<p class='c013'>At last the German Army was within a day’s march
of Paris. Pretty American girls who had acquaintances
among the German officers actually received letters from
them arranging to come to tea with them! Every soldier
in the great German Army believed that in twenty-four
hours he would be comfortably resting in the most luxurious
quarters in Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then suddenly, it will never be known exactly how,
but probably through their clever airmen, the enemy’s
commanders learnt that, hidden safely in the Palace of
Versailles and under the great trees of the park surrounding
that palace, was a new French army of fresh troops.
Had the Germans penetrated into Paris, this army would
have cut off their retreat and caught them, according to
the proverbial saying, “like rats in a trap.” So it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>that, instead of making their triumphal entry into Paris,
the rushing, oncoming hosts swerved to one side, and
very soon there developed close to Paris the great fights
which will live in history under the names of the Battle of
Meaux and the Battle of the Marne.</p>

<p class='c013'>Superior people rather despise those who believe in
omens, but sometimes even the holy and the learned
find great comfort in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most notable scholars in France belong to the
Academy of Inscriptions in Paris. Now, in spite of the
fact that war was raging and the enemy close to the gates
of their city, these learned men decided to hold their usual
monthly meeting. The proceedings opened with the
statement that there had just been presented to the Louvre
a Greek statue of surpassing charm and interest, the first
gift made to the Louvre Museum since the outbreak of
the war. After a short pause, the speaker added the
words, “Gentlemen, the statue is that of the Winged
Victory.” And all these grave old scholars rose to their
feet and cheered the omen to the echo!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was near Meaux that the German Army, commanded
by the skilful and resourceful General von Kluck, seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>to have met quite unexpectedly the large reserves of men—perhaps
it is a mistake to call them an army—which had
been brought up there by General Joffre. There are
certain other notable facts about this battle which
make me wish you should specially remember it, and that
though its glories were somewhat dimmed by the greater
and more important Battle of the Marne.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Battle of Meaux turned the tide of the first
German campaign. By a strange irony of fate, Von
Kluck seems to have first got wind of the new French
army on September 1. It was on September 2, 1870,
that the Battle of Sedan was fought, the French suffering
a crushing defeat at the hands of the Germans. The
Germans confidently expected to enter Paris again on
September 2, 1914, and celebrate there the anniversary of
their great triumph. Not only was this confident expectation
disappointed, but it was on that very day that they
were forced to begin their retreat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before I begin to tell you of some of the deeds of
valour and heroism performed during these two battles,
I should like to tell you one or two interesting things
about the town of Meaux.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Bossuet, who spoke so beautifully that, like St.
Chrysostom, he was called “the golden mouthed,” was
Archbishop of Meaux; he was also a brave and fearless
man, and one of those who leave the world in which
they live—in his case, a brilliant, frivolous, selfish world—better
than they find it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The present Bishop of Meaux is a worthy successor to
Bossuet. When the Germans entered the town, the bishop
was the only man of authority who remained at his post.
The Mayor had advised the inhabitants to leave as soon as
the Germans drew near. He and the other officials all
went. The bishop refused to join them, saying, “My duty
is here. I do not think the enemy will harm me, but
if they do, God’s will be done. I cannot leave my
cathedral. I cannot leave those of my flock who remain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the Germans arrived, the bishop parleyed with
their commanding officer and exacted a promise that his
men should behave well. And they did. So we may well
exclaim, “Bravo, brave bishop!”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a little town close to Meaux called Château-Thierry,
where much fighting took place, was the cheerful home
of another Frenchman whose name some of you certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>know. I mean La Fontaine, who wrote the delightful
animal fables. The hotels of Château-Thierry are very
happily and appropriately named: they are called The
Elephant, The Giraffe, and The Swan. The poor Giraffe
was battered all to bits during the great battle, I am sorry
to say, by the shells of the French, who with their help
successfully dislodged the Germans. But the owner of
the Giraffe is such an unselfish patriot that when showing
his wounded house to an English gentleman after the
battle, he exclaimed, “See how splendidly true our
gunners’ aim was!” pointing out with pride that every
single window had been neatly smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think most of you will envy the two Eton boys who
were on a bicycle tour in France when the war broke out,
and who, when the tide began to turn, suddenly found
themselves in the fighting zone! By luck more than anything
else they stumbled on to the French General Staff,
and there came across an English officer. Both implored
him to help them to get into the French Army, and, amazing
to tell, they were both made honorary sub-lieutenants.
Soon they were put on the Commission which had the
business of examining the villages improperly devastated
by the enemy, for sad to say, as soon as the Germans began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to get the worst of it, they wreaked their vengeance on
the innocent inhabitants of the villages and small towns
through which they were retreating.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mean people always suspect others of being as mean
as themselves. The Germans believe that the taking of
an unfair advantage is quite the right thing to do in war.
But in the end these practices recoil on their doers and keep
them in a miserable state of constant fear and suspicion.</p>

<p class='c013'>A worthy French priest and two innocent little boys
very nearly fell a victim to the enemy’s terrors. The
Germans were having a rest in a village, when their commander
noticed that the church clock was stopped. He
sent for the priest, and demanded that the clock should
be set going again. The curé, accompanied by two of
his choir boys, went to wind it up; and as was natural,
when once it was wound up it began to strike. The
German commander, in a great fright, decided that this
was a dodge invented by the curé to warn the French
that a number of weary Germans were in his village. At
once he had him arrested, and the two little boys as well.
Without more ado all three were sentenced to be shot
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>All three were brave, but we can imagine what a sad
night they must have spent, and how especially sad the
old priest must have been that, owing to the fact that he
had allowed the two lads to accompany him, they were
to have their young lives cut short in such a dreadful way.
Early in the morning, an hour before they were to have
been executed, the news reached the Germans that the
French were on them. They rushed out of the village,
forgetting all about their captives. Meanwhile, the priest
was so convinced that his last hour had come that he himself
opened the door of his temporary prison and went to
the village green in order to await the firing party, and to
make a last appeal to them to spare the two lads. You
can imagine his joy when he saw the familiar blue and red
uniforms of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class='c013'>This great war has been illumined by star-like deeds
of beautiful, simple humanity, performed, in many cases,
by men who were unconscious of their own heroism.
One such still shines forth from the Battle of Meaux.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Scottish regiment was occupying a trench, swept by
violent rifle and artillery fire, when two privates noticed
that a Frenchman, attached to the battalion as interpreter,
occupied the most exposed place in the trench.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“The Frenchman is awkwardly placed,” observed
one of them, “let us widen his trench.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At once the two Scots, paying no attention to the hail
of bullets and shrapnel, set to deepening the trench, after
which they calmly went back to their own stations.</p>

<p class='c013'>I expect some of you will envy a certain French boy
named André. He lived in Paris, and on the declaration
of war he watched with very mixed feelings his brother
and most of the grown-up men he knew start off for the
front. In France every man between the ages of eighteen
and forty-five is, in time of war, a soldier, ready to defend
his dear country to the last drop of his blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>André was only twelve years old, but when he heard
that the enemy was now close to Paris, he decided that he
must go and defend his country too. So he suddenly
disappeared, leaving a letter which ran:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My dear father and mother,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I am starting for the war. Don’t worry about
me. I have my savings bank money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After nearly a fortnight a sunburnt André reappeared
in Paris, and told all that had befallen him. It had been
quite easy for him to find the army, and the soldiers hadn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>had the heart to send him away. Marching with them by
day, and sleeping in their bivouacs or billets at night, he
stayed with them until the battalion reached Meaux. There
the colonel began to ask questions. André’s soldier friends
had to confess that they had adopted him as a human
mascot. The colonel sent for André, and although at
first very angry, soon relaxed into a broad smile, but insisted
that the boy’s share in the campaign must now
come to an end, and so André went sadly home.</p>

<p class='c013'>In these days when hundreds of thousands of soldiers
are pitted against one another, a battle consists of a number
of separate fights, or, as we call them now, engagements.
It was in one of these, during this same battle of Meaux,
that a perambulator figures in a grand deed of heroism.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hero of this story is an infantry officer, one who
had only just left St. Cyr (the French Sandhurst, and once,
funnily enough, the most famous girls’ school in the whole
world), and who first went under fire at the Battle of
Meaux. Looking round in the thick of the fight he saw
his major, who was a very small man, lying severely
wounded in a field swept by the fire of the German guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were some houses close by. Into one of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Lieutenant Gesrel ran, and he came out wheeling a
perambulator. The men lying about him, taking what
shelter they could, looked at him in amazement. He
wheeled it briskly, but without appearing to hurry, out
into the bullet-swept open space, until he came to where
the major lay.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men could hear the wounded officer protest.
“Go away,” he said. “Leave me; I shall be all right.
It’s madness to expose yourself like that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lieutenant took no heed of this, but picked his
major up, put him in the perambulator, and started to
wheel it back to the edge of the little wood. At last he
reached safety with his precious burden. Then he ran
and joined his men in the fight again.</p>

<p class='c013'>I expect you have heard how, at Fontenoy, the French
called out to the British, “Fire first, gentlemen.”
But the latter refused to fire, shouting back at once
rudely and politely, “No, gentlemen and assassins, you
begin!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This famous exchange of courtesies is recalled by the
action of another French lieutenant, who, during a sharp
fight which took place round a small railway station near
Meaux, pursued a German officer into a locomotive shed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and found him under the tender of an engine. The two
looked each other up and down, and by tacit agreement
took up a duelling position at fifteen paces. “Please
fire first,” cried the French officer. The German fired
and missed. Then the Frenchman fired and hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last human quality one would naturally associate
with war is kindness. Yet it is not too much to say that
every great battle, every scene of carnage, is brightened
by truly wonderful acts of kindness. By this I do not
mean deeds of heroism, the saving of one gallant soldier
by a pal, but simple, homely kindness. Such was the
following:</p>

<p class='c011'>Trooper Philippe, of the 2nd Chasseurs, under heavy
artillery fire, bullets and shrapnel falling thickly, not only
brought his captain in, but after that went back eight
times more to take water to the wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>A French soldier, wounded in this same battle of Meaux,
had with him a dog nestled in his coat while the fighting
was going on, as it was apparently terrified at the noise of
the firing. The soldier fed it from his rations, and after
he was wounded smuggled it in the train which took him
to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Our own soldiers have always had a special fondness
for dogs. It is said that when a dog once enters barracks
he never afterwards seeks to change his quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Vittoria the Guards made a poodle puppy a prisoner,
and it became their pet. At Bidart, when Colonel Ponsonby
was encouraging his men to advance, they were
delighted to see the poodle jumping and barking, much
amused at the bullets which rained round him. Colonel
Ponsonby and the poodle were wounded at the same
moment, a bullet breaking one of the dog’s legs. He
was, however, tenderly nursed, and the rest of his life
was happy, although spent on only three legs.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c012'>THE BATTLE OF THE AISNE</span></h2>

      <div class='line in36'><span class='sc'>Arthur Clough.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>After the German army had fallen back a long,
long way, close on a hundred miles, they suddenly
came to a stop, and prepared for a new
and desperate stand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gradually, those of us who were watching anxiously
from far off, learnt what the men at the front knew almost
at once; General von Kluck had decided to turn and face
his pursuers along the line of the river Aisne. It was an
excellent choice. This river, broad and deep, was one of
the easiest to defend in the whole of Europe. Moreover,
von Kluck was well aware that in days of peace cunning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Germans, masquerading in many cases as quiet wine merchants,
had prepared there a series of almost impregnable
trenches. Now the word impregnable means “impossible
to take,” and when our officers, later, saw the trenches out
of which the Germans had been driven, they declared that
our men would have held them for ever!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was there, in the beautiful country of vineyards
and of the low, swelling hills which surround the famous
town of Rheims, that began what has come to be known as
the Battle of the Aisne.</p>

<p class='c013'>I expect most of you know the meaning of the word
“fortress.” Those of you who don’t will understand
it best if I tell you that in old days every castle was a
fortress. It was so built with ramparts, battlements, and
little narrow windows, that every stone of it could be
defended, either by archers with bows and arrows, or
with men and guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the most striking fact about the great Battle of
the Aisne, which, beginning on September 10, was to
last longer than any previous battle in the history of the
world, was that on the German side it was exactly like
fortress or castle fighting. I mean that the Germans, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a foresight which did credit to their cleverness, had
evidently thought it possible, though not probable, that
they might be pushed far back, as in fact they were.
They had, therefore, prepared long beforehand trenches
and quarries which, from a little way off, actually looked
like the battlements of a castle. There, snugly hidden
behind natural and artificial ramparts, they were able to
keep the British troops and those of our ally at bay
during many long weary days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The German trenches were all ready for the enemy to
step into them, but every British and French trench had
to be dug out and prepared at short notice. This, however,
was soon done, and then there began that strange
“life in the trenches,” of which so many vivid accounts
were written home by officers and privates.</p>

<p class='c013'>You will certainly want to know what a trench is like.
A one-man trench is best described by its other name,
“dug-out.” It is a large, neat hole, cut so deeply in the
ground that a man can stand upright in it without being
seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a great art in digging a trench. When finished
it should be not unlike a tiny cottage room; the floor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>however, is quite unlike that of a room, for instead of being
flat it is slightly sloped, so that any rain that gets in may
run away quickly. At the side there is a step, so that
the occupier, when he cares to do so, can cautiously raise
his head above the ground and look round. The best
trenches have a kind of roof or head-cover. This
protects the man inside, not only from rain and sun, but
also from the awful bullets which come out of the shrapnel
shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to know that the shrapnel shell, which
has done such deadly harm in this war both to ourselves
and to the enemy, is called after a distinguished English
soldier, General Henry Shrapnel, who invented it. On the
park gates of the ancestral home of the Shrapnel family
near Trowbridge are still to be seen inscribed the names
of over twenty battles won with the aid of this shell. Sir
George Wood, who commanded the artillery at Waterloo,
declared that we owed to shrapnel the recovery of La
Haye Sainte, on which part of the battle depended.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to what trench life was like during the long Battle
of the Aisne, it was in some ways like playing at keeping
house.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>When I was a little girl I often played at keeping
house with my brother, but as we were very fond
of soldiers, and lived in a stretch of beautiful country
which was very suitable for <i><span lang="fr">la petite guerre</span></i>, as military
manœuvres were then called in France, our house was
always a tent.</p>

<p class='c013'>In those days we knew nothing of trenches, or it
would have been a trench. Into our little house—we
always called it a house though it was really a tent, for the
roof was always made with a sheet, and the door was a
big towel—we used to bring all the sort of things that
we thought soldiers would want. But in these days a
soldier’s requirements have grown, if only because he has
to live in his trench for far longer than the soldier of
long ago used to live in his tent.</p>

<p class='c011'>I think it may interest some of you to know both what
an officer generally has, and what he would like to have,
with him, when he is in a trench. He generally has a
canteen containing a knife, fork, and spoon; also a sponge,
a tooth-brush, a piece of soap, and an extra pair of socks.
As to a change of clothes, boots, and sleeping bag, they
form part of his equipment. He also has a water-bottle,
a revolver, a pair of field-glasses, and a compass. Only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>if he is lucky does he possess as extras a waterproof sheet,
a torch with re-fills (many on the Aisne preferred candles),
a canvas bucket, notepaper and envelopes, and an air
pillow. There should be six thick pairs of socks made of
good wool, twelve coloured handkerchiefs, four thick
flannel shirts (khaki colour), a good wide comforter, and
two sleeping caps (in case one gets wet). Any pencils
sent to a man on active service ought to be indelible.
Valuable, too, is a tiny medicine chest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very few people realise what an important part food—good,
hot, and plenty of it—plays in war. Napoleon,
who was the first great general to study closely the comfort
of his troops, would have admired and envied the British
commissariat.</p>

<p class='c011'>However fierce the fighting during the Battle of the
Aisne, there was in each trench or dug-out “the dinner
’ush from twelve to one.” The shells might continue to
roar, and men be hit by bullets, but out fifty yards behind
the trench the battalion reserves had their fires alight and
were cooking dinner. Fifty yards of shell-swept ground
behind men in trenches is, however, a long way off.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were, however, always plenty of volunteers
ready to rush to the belt of trees and return triumphant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>with mess-tins riddled with shrapnel bullets and some of
their number on the ground, but with dinner safe for the
famished battalion.</p>

<p class='c013'>I wonder if you can guess what is the worst thing
connected with life in the trenches? It is not the
cold or the heat. It is not the damp or the wet. It
is not even the fact that the soldier, however cleverly
he may be entrenched, is in perpetual danger of death,
or if not of death itself, then of some terrible and
painful wound.</p>

<p class='c011'>No, the worst thing about life in the trenches is the
noise! All day long, and very often all night too, the boom
of the great guns, and the long drawn-out screaming
whistle of the shells, went on, backwards and forwards,
across that narrow valley of the Aisne. Who can wonder
that many of our brave soldiers were made temporarily
deaf?</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet, in spite of the distracting noise, a good deal
of reading was done, for quite a number of books had
been brought to the trenches.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the officers of the 1st Hampshire Regiment
actually read Sir Walter Scott’s poem of “Marmion”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>aloud to his men while they were being subjected to a
continuous fire. This fact becoming known to a retired
naval officer, Commander Henry N. Shore, he wrote the
following interesting letter to a paper:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Curiously enough, the same thing happened a century
ago during the last great war in which Great Britain
was engaged. While Wellington’s army held the lines of
Torres Vedras, a captain in an infantry regiment wrote
to Sir Walter Scott telling him that while his men were
waiting for an attack by the French he excited their martial
ardour by reciting aloud to them a canto of ‘Marmion’
which had recently been published. Thus does history
repeat itself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The French soldiers during this long drawn-out battle
were astonished at the tidiness and cleanliness of their
British comrades. Every morning our soldiers did their
best to perform their toilets in the trenches, and that
however hard the night had been. Each man had a little
bit of looking-glass which he put up on the chalky earth,
then he got his water and soap to hand, and shaved and
washed as though for a parade! There was no compulsion;
it was done because each man wanted to do it, and
knew he would feel the better for it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>This kind of siege battle is very wearing to those
engaged in it. The dogged courage, day and night, which
it requires, seems to me every bit as splendid as those
more striking deeds of gallantry for which men win the
V.C. As a private wrote:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We don’t care tuppence for shrapnel, which flies back
and hardly ever hits us. What worries us is that the
Germans have been turning their heavy siege guns upon
us. The shells they fire are no joke. They rip a hole
in the ground big enough to bury an entire regiment.
One man standing near me was hurled into the lower
branches of a tree by the concussion. We got him down,
and strange to say he was comparatively unhurt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That makes one think of Sir Walter Scott’s lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three hundred cannon-mouths roared loud,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from their throats with flash and cloud</div>
      <div class='line'>Their showers of iron threw.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was early in the Battle of the Aisne that a British
gunner, already slightly wounded, went on serving his
gun, when suddenly down whizzed a shell and severely
injured his leg. He picked himself up and calmly went
on with his perilous job. The action was then very hot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and he refused to receive first aid. At last, when it
became clear he could go on no longer, he was forced by
his comrades to leave his post of duty and danger, but
it took two of them to hold him down on the ambulance
stretcher!</p>

<p class='c013'>The Russians have an excellent proverb, “The bullet
is a fool, but the bayonet is a brave fellow.” The bullet,
however, especially when shot by one of our British
soldiers, is by no means a fool, as our enemies have again
and again found to their cost. The German soldiers
usually fired their rifles at random from the hip. But our
men are trained to take aim steadily from the shoulder,
and so not many British bullets are wasted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The modern bullet has a tremendous range. Before
the Battle of Omdurman a wounded officer was placed at
what was thought to be five thousand yards from the
nearest point of fire. Yet a stray bullet traversed those
three miles of desert, and striking him on the head
killed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>One is glad to know that the latest type of bullet
usually inflicts quite a small, clean wound, which heals
up quickly. In old days it was thought that no one could
survive being shot through the heart, but it has now been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>proved that a bullet may actually puncture the heart
without doing any permanent harm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes—and this is a very piteous and woeful
thought—a wounded soldier has to lie out a long time on
the field of battle before he can be carried in. I am
sorry to say that the Germans often fired on the men
sent out to pick up wounded. As an example, I will
tell you of the case of a soldier whose left thigh was
fractured and right foot wounded in a very fierce engagement.
He lay alone among the dead and dying,
unseen, and apparently without any power of attracting
the attention of the ambulance men. At last he plucked
up enough strength to crawl along towards the British
trenches.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was about finished,” he wrote afterwards, “when
a man of the Welsh Regiment saw me and came out for me.
That man ought to get the Victoria Cross. I didn’t ask
his name, and I don’t know what it was, but he was a real
good one, and no mistake. He got me up on his shoulders
and he carried me right in. The Germans were firing all
the time, and I was so near finished that I wanted him
to drop me and let me die. It didn’t seem right for him
to be worrying about getting me in. All he said was, ‘You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>hold tight, old man; I’ve got you all right, and I don’t
intend to let you go!’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Wherever the British wounded passed they were loaded
with gifts by the French peasants. Old men and women,
children even, brought them the best they had. They
would bring the milk kept for the baby’s bottle, or their
only and much valued bottle of champagne or old wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Lancashire private showed his comrades an agricultural
medal an old man had given him. “It is not
much in itself, I dare say,” he said, to excuse the tears in
his eyes, “but I could see it was what the old fellow was
proudest of, so you see I have to keep it careful.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of you, when walking through one of our beautiful,
peaceful, country churchyards, may have cast a sad
thought to the lonely graves where so many of our bravest
soldiers lie in France. But let me tell you that one of the
best traits in the French character is respect for death.
A tramp found dead on the wayside near a French village
will be given a decent funeral, and what is more there
will be women present, not only at the Mass said for his
soul, but also at the grave side.</p>

<p class='c011'>That being so, you will readily imagine with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>reverence and care the British dead who have died fighting
for France have been treated by the people whose
sad fate it has been to live close to the great battlefields of
this war. After each action the dead were sought for,
and after their personal possessions had been put aside
for their relations, they were buried on a strip of ground
called “The Field of Honour.” There French and British
lie side by side, as you will see from the following letter
written by a lieutenant of the Royal Army Medical Corps
serving with the 2nd Seaforth Highlanders:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Colonel Bradford! I can’t tell you how great
our loss is. He was brave, and a born commander, but
in the twinkling of an eye, while trying to safeguard his
regiment, a shell carried him off. We could not fetch
him in during daylight because of drawing fire, but at
midnight, on September 14, we laid him with two other
officers and men to rest in their <i><span lang="fr">champ d’honneur</span></i>, on a
hillside overlooking a fair river and valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a sad but glorious moment for us to stand and
hear the padre tell us that they had not shrunk from
duty, and had fallen for the sake of comrades. The next
day I found some Scotch thistle growing close by. I
plucked the blooms, and formed a cross over our chieftain’s
grave.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>In a letter to Miss Rose-Innes, of Jedburgh, Colonel
Richardson-Drummond-Hay, writing from the regimental
quarters of the Coldstream Guards at the Battle of the
Aisne, paid a splendid tribute to a Scots surgeon, named
Dr. Huggan. It told how two days before the young
man was killed he was recommended for the Victoria
Cross for organising and leading a party of volunteers
to remove a number of wounded from a barn that
had been set alight by the German shells. The work was
carried out under very heavy fire, and all the wounded
were saved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Huggan, who was killed at the Battle of the Aisne
on September 16, was a member of the Royal Army
Medical Corps, attached to the 3rd Battalion Coldstream
Guards. He was a native of Jedburgh, and played Rugby
with the Jedforest Club for some years.</p>

<p class='c013'>The doctors on both sides have taken a splendid
part in this great war.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let me tell you here of an exceptionally kind and
delicate-minded action on the part of a German doctor.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a French town temporarily captured by the
Germans, a certain French gentleman lay very ill. He
was an old man, too old for fighting, and just now too ill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>to be moved away by his friends. There were no French
doctors left in the town. Hearing of this case, one of
the German doctors took off his uniform, put on an overall,
and pretended to be a captured English doctor, in order
to go and see the sick man. He took all this trouble
because he thought the excitement (hatred of the Germans
by his patient) would be bad for the old gentleman. This
was all the kinder, inasmuch as, being an Army doctor,
he was, of course, under no obligation to treat people
in the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am sorry that I cannot tell you the name of one of the
bravest men mentioned in this book. There is, however,
one fact about him which can be stated. He is a private
in the West Yorkshire Regiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>This soldier was in the trenches when suddenly he
saw that close to the German lines a number of his comrades
had been struck down while in the act of charging
the enemy. He took off his coat and equipment, and
walked over to where they lay under a perfect hail of
bullets. Beginning with the adjutant, he made altogether
eleven journeys, bringing in also his colonel and nine
men. Small wonder that he is said to have been recommended
for the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>During the first two months of the war, the British
Veterinary Corps, which, by the way, was first formed
after the South African War, had 30,000 horse patients
through its hands. Horses, in spite of motor transport,
have already played an important part in this great war,
and it does not require much thought to know that their
supply in almost every country is limited. Russia alone
seems to have an inexhaustible number—in fact, it has been
asserted that there are no fewer than thirty million horses
at the disposal of the Tsar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our horses are better looked after than any others in
the field. The wounded ones are cared for most tenderly,
and are often cured of quite serious wounds. Not only
have they their comfortable hospitals, but there have
actually been set apart for them splendid convalescent
homes. Some of these consist of the fine racing stables
belonging to well-known Frenchmen whose colours are
often seen on English racecourses.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have been told that one of the strangest and, in a
sense, most pathetic sights on the battlefields of the Aisne
was the loose horses which rushed hither and thither aimlessly
while shells whistled overhead. Another curious
sight is the terror of the birds when an aeroplane flies low.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>They swirl about, beside themselves with fright, and
evidently believe that the flying machine is a huge monster
of their own kind bent upon their extermination.</p>

<p class='c013'>A private of the Royal Irish Fusiliers described how
he and his comrades once went under fire:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As we stood up, there was a ghastly shower of
bullets, and shells burst all round. Into it we had to
go, and as I looked ahead one of our chaps said, ‘I think
we’ll have to get our great-coats, boys; it’s raining bullets
to-night, and we’ll get wet if we’re not careful.’ Men of
“C” Company started laughing, and then they took to
singing ‘Put up your umbrellas when it comes on wet!’
The song was taken up all along as we went into the
thick of it, and some of us were humming it as we dashed
into the German trenches.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the retreat from Mons a slightly wounded
Scot, an artilleryman, asked a German for water, and was
refused. Long afterwards, during the Battle of the Aisne,
the artilleryman recognised the same German among
a party of wounded whose cries for water couldn’t be
attended to quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>The recognition was mutual, and the German stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>his moaning, thinking he was sure to be paid back in his
own coin. But the Highlander took out his water-bottle
and handed it to the German without a word. According
to one who was there, the German had the grace to look
very shamefaced indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our flying men played a most important part in this
Battle of the Aisne. What they did, and how they did
it, was excellently described in the following letter written
by Lord Castlereagh from Champagne. As you read it
you will feel as if you were there, watching the wonderful
and inspiring sight:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The thing that has impressed me most here has been
the aeroplane service, a splendid lot of boys who really
do not know what fear is. The Germans shoot shrapnel
at them, and you see the aeroplane like a dragon-fly in
the air, and then a lot of little puffs of white smoke, which
are the shells bursting. Luckily the shots are very wide,
and so far none have been brought down. One man was
shot in the thigh by a German airman whom he was
chasing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I watched for twenty-five minutes an aeroplane
doing what is called ‘ranging’ for a battery of heavy guns.
The aeroplane watches where the shells drop, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>signals to say where the shells are falling, whether too far
or not far enough. This aeroplane was being shelled by
the enemy with shrapnel, and three times it flew round
and showed the battery where they were shooting. The
Germans must have fired forty shells.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The aeroplane, about five thousand feet up, and
easily in sight, looked like an eagle, and about the same
size, and the shells made a cloud of white smoke and
looked about the size of a cabbage. It was a wonderful
sight, and if such a picture appeared in an illustrated
paper no one would think it was anything else but an
imaginary one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On September 22 a daring exploit was performed by
a group of British aviators. They flew off and made
a successful raid into Germany. Flight-Lieut. C. H.
Collet dropped three bombs on the Zeppelin shed at
Düsseldorf, and as the whole shed burst into flames it
is clear that his object was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both this gallant airman and his companion were
most careful to do no harm to private or public buildings
in the towns through which they flew. In fact, they could
have destroyed another Zeppelin shed had they not
thought it wrong to run the risk of injuring innocent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>women and children in the misty weather which then
prevailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot help contrasting this behaviour with the
conduct of German airmen, who killed or mutilated
with their bombs numbers of women and children in open
towns like Paris and Ostend.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the most gallant deeds of this great war
have been done some way from the fields of battle,
and in what may be called cold blood. A fine story
of Irish heroism was told by a trooper of the Irish
Dragoons:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a man of ours who carried a chum to a
farmhouse under fire, and when the retreat came got left
behind. A German patrol called and found them. There
were only the two, one wounded, against a dozen Uhlans.
Behind a barrier of furniture they kept the Germans at
bay. At last the Germans made off and brought a machine
gun to the house and threatened to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The two soldiers were not unmindful of the kindness
shown them by the owners of the farm, and rather than
bring loss on them or the village they made a rush out
with some mad idea of taking the gun. Just over the
threshold of the door they both fell dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Among the most moving and beautiful stories of this
great struggle is one that also has as hero a nameless Irish
private. What happened was perfectly told by a wounded
corporal of the West Yorkshire Regiment:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The regiment was approaching a little village near
Rheims. We went on through the long narrow street, and
just as we were in sight of the end the figure of a man
dashed out from a farmhouse on the right. Immediately
the rifles began to crack in front, and the poor chap fell
dead before he reached us.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We learned that he had been captured the previous
day by a marauding party of German cavalry, and had
been held a prisoner at the farm where the Germans were
in ambush for us. He tumbled to their game, and though
he knew that if he made the slightest sound they would
kill him, he decided to make a dash to warn us of what
was in store.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had more than a dozen bullets in him, and there
was not the slightest hope for him, so we carried him into
a house until the fight was over. We buried him the next
day with military honours, but as his identification disc
and everything else was missing, we could only put over
his grave the tribute that was paid to a greater: ‘He
saved others; himself he could not save.’”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>I should now like to tell you something of our
great ally, Russia, and of the gallant deeds performed
by her soldiers in this war.</p>

<p class='c013'>Valour does not belong to one nation more than to
another, but each country, and this is rather a curious
fact, has its own kind of valour. The British excel
in what I should call the “forlorn hope”—the kind
of valour that stood our soldiers in such fine stead at
Mons, and during Sir John French’s magnificent retreat.
The Marquis of Montrose embodied the spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>England and this peculiar stoical type of valour when
he wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He either fears his fate too much,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or his deserts are small,</div>
      <div class='line'>That dares not put it to the touch</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To gain or lose it all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Briton never fears his fate too much to put it to
the touch—that is why he generally gains it all!</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the Russian has a singularly splendid kind of
valour. It is the kind that faces <em>certain</em> death for love
of country, with joy rather than with resignation. Never
in the history of mankind was a finer thing done than
the sailing of the Russian Fleet to certain doom, during
the Russo-Japanese War. Every man, from admiral to
stoker, knew of the fate awaiting him, and every man went
cheerfully to the encounter for the sake of “Holy Russia.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This courage of the Russians is part of their grand
passion for romance, or what people now call idealism. A
great many years ago a writer quaintly and truly wrote in
<cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>: “I have seen the unromantic
drop like sheep under the rot of their calamities, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>romantic have been buoyant and mastered them.” So
never let anyone laugh us out of being romantic. Too
often those who try to do so are in the sad case of the fox
who, having lost his tail, could not endure to see any other
fox with one.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was this same peculiar strain of magnificent, romantic
courage which made the Governor of Moscow, after
having given orders to burn the city, when Napoleon and
his Grand Army were approaching, himself set fire to his
own beloved house. This great deed will live in the long
noble history of human sacrifice and valour as long as the
world endures, for it was the burning of Moscow which
turned the tide against the greatest conqueror Europe
had known since Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Russians are as mighty with the pen as with the
sword. The finest story ever written on war was written
by a Russian named Count Tolstoi. It is called “War and
Peace.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And now to the Russians this great war with Germany
is a crusade, a holy war. They are fighting for their
fellow-Slavs, who like them belong to the Greek Church,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and who if they became Germans and Austrians would
be most cruelly oppressed by their conquerors. So
strong is this feeling in Russia that it has united everyone—from
the Tsar to the poorest moujik—in one great
passion for justice and freedom.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following moving letter from his mother was
found on the breast of a Russian officer killed in action.
It will show you more than anything I can tell you how
Russia feels about this war:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your father was killed very far from us, and I send
you for the sacred duty of defending our dear country
from the vile and dreadful enemy. Remember you are
the son of a hero. My heart is oppressed, and I weep
when I ask you to be worthy of him. I know all the
fateful horror of these words, what suffering it will be for
me and you, but we do not live for ever in this world.
What is our life? A drop in the ocean of beautiful Russia.
We must die, but she will live for ever. I know we shall
be forgotten, and our happy descendants will not remember
those who sleep in ‘brothers’ graves’ (soldiers’ graves).</p>

<p class='c011'>“With kisses and blessings I parted with you. When
you are sent to perform a great deed, don’t remember my
tears but only my blessing. God save you, my dear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>bright, loved child. One word more; it is written everywhere
that the enemy is cruel and savage. Don’t be led
by blind vengeance. Don’t raise your hand at a fallen
foe, but be gracious to those whose fate it is to fall into
your hands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What a noble and beautiful end is that to this letter,
but how one’s heart aches for the writer now that the
dear, bright, beloved son sleeps in “brothers’ graves.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of all the Tsar’s soldiers the most typically Russian is
the Cossack. Now the Cossack has been well described
as being a man of war from his youth upwards. He is
always the child of a soldier, and his mother cradles him
with war songs. When he gets a little older and begins
crawling about the floor, his games are mimic battles, and
his father takes him off to the stables for at least an hour
every day that he may regard horses as his friends and
playfellows.</p>

<p class='c011'>At seventeen he becomes a Cossack, and after a very
few weeks’ training he is ready for war. The Cossack’s
equipment is most peculiar, and it is so arranged that he
can creep along, even when on horseback, quite noiselessly.
A proverb in Russia runs: “One dragoon makes more
noise than a regiment of Cossacks!” The Cossack’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>claim is that what mortal man can do he will do, and a
great deal more besides. As a rule he is a small man
and his horse is a small horse, in fact what we should
call a pony. No cavalryman is on better terms with
his mount, and many and many a time a Cossack has
given his life for his horse. But a Cossack never allows
his mount to know what the inside of a comfortable
stable is like; the Cossack’s horse has to learn to be as
hardy as his master.</p>

<p class='c013'>Small wonder therefore that the Cossacks are the most
amazingly clever horsemen in the world. One of their
favourite manœuvres, when on active service, is to swing
down beneath their horses’ girths, thus causing the enemy
to believe that they have before them a number of runaway
horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story goes that a patrol of ten Cossacks lately
came upon a German squadron who, to avoid a fight at
close quarters, opened fire. The Russian horsemen swung
round under their horses; the Germans mounted and set
forth to capture what they believed to be runaway horses.
When they came close up the Cossacks reappeared in the
saddle, and attacking them with awful fury, cut them to
pieces!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The Cossacks have retained their old, picturesque
uniform—not for them the sober khaki—and an action
in which they engage recalls the verse of Robert Burns:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The trumpets sound, the banners fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>The glittering spears are rankêd ready,</div>
      <div class='line'>The shouts o’ war are heard afar,</div>
      <div class='line'>The battle closes thick and bloody.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Cossack trooper has a great deal of that simple,
resourceful cunning which is so important an asset to all
sportsmen and fighting men.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was shown in the present war by the adventure
of one such brave horseman called Polkovnikoff, who
was taken prisoner by the Austrians.</p>

<p class='c011'>His captors treated Polkovnikoff kindly, and asked him
many questions concerning his famous corps. “How do
you manage to unsaddle just in front of the enemy’s entrenchments,
and attack them on foot? Is not your horse
a drag upon you?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Polkovnikoff volunteered to show how it was done, so
they lent him a fine horse, belonging to an officer, to enable
him to make an exhibition of his skill. Conscientiously
and artistically he went through some vaulting exercises.
Then, in order to put the finishing touch to one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>feats, he went the furthest possible distance from the
assembled company, and, before they realised what was
happening, he had put spurs to the horse and was galloping
madly away!</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful little sketch of a Cossack officer will
show you how fortunate these Russian cavalrymen are
in their leaders. It was written by a British war correspondent
on his way to the front.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At Pavlodar a Cossack officer came on board, who
will ever stand out in our memory as a great little man.
He was clean-shaven, fat, and jolly-looking. Within two
hours he had the reservists under his thumb to such an
extent that had they been asked to storm, unarmed as
they were, a German position, they would have gone
without hesitation! His treatment was paternal, almost
to the extent of the schoolroom. He read to them, and he
told them funny little stories. Then he made them sing
choruses, and wound up by warning them that upon their
arrival at the great concentration camp of Omsk they
must remember to treat all strangers with courtesy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A Cossack never “retires” from active service. He
goes on being a fighting man as long as he can ride well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and straight. A Cossack whose leg was amputated
clamoured for a quick recovery that he might go back to
the front. The doctor asked him what he could do in the
war with only one leg. He replied proudly, “Have I not
still my strong right arm with which to strike down the
enemy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>All grown-up people hope that among the very best
consequences of this great war will be the restoration of
freedom and happiness to heroic Poland. It is the unhappy
fate of this valiant country to be, as it were, a buffer
State. I expect you know that a buffer is something
wedged in between two contending forces. India-rubber,
which is at once hard and yielding, makes an excellent
buffer. Poland is between Russia and Germany, and
before the war she had been divided between them.
Neither had treated her well, but for many years past
Germany treated her part of Poland with far more harshness
than Russia treated hers. As a consequence of this,
even German Poland now sides with Russia, the more so
that the Tsar, very early in the war, issued a general proclamation
in which he promised the Poles their freedom
after victory.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Poland has been the scene of some fierce conflicts, and
the Poles have had the opportunity of performing many
gallant deeds. The Polish villagers have also been very
good to the wounded of both sides. In one village a
little girl of seven years old went up to a wounded man and
saw that he was bleeding dreadfully from a wound in his
head. She tried her best to staunch the blood with her
pinafore, but as it went on coming through she put her
hand tight down on the place, and sent her baby brother
to fetch an ambulance man.</p>

<p class='c013'>You will remember how more than one French boy
managed to get to the front. This has also happened in
Russia. Indeed, it is said that there boys as young as
eight years have run away from home in the hope of fighting
for Holy Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Touching stories of the kind are being told in Petrograd
concerning not only boys but girls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very soon after the war broke out, four little girls
made their way to a police station. Each had a bundle
on her back, each wore a Red Cross armlet. The police
inspector was much surprised to see them. “Has someone
sent you with these things?” he asked, pointing to
their bundles. “If so, you must go on to the hospital.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“No, indeed,” said the boldest of the four;  “we have
come here on our way to the front. We intend to nurse
the soldiers ourselves.” Proudly they exhibited their
bundles, which contained bits of old linen and cotton
wool. The inspector did not like to make fun of these
valiant and patriotic little girls, so he kept them there
while he sent out men to look for their parents. At last
these arrived. The spokeswoman of the party then turned
on the inspector and, with a look of grave reproach, exclaimed,
“We trusted you with our secret, and now you
have given us away!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And here I must stop and tell you that very early in this
stupendous war, where whole nations and their manhood
are engaged, Russia did a very noble thing by her allies.
Knowing that Germany had thrown her full strength
into an effort to defeat, once for all, the British and the
French armies, the Russian Commander-in-Chief made
up his mind to create what is called a diversion. Although
he was not yet really ready to meet so powerful and fully
prepared a foe, he threw a large force over the German
frontier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Filled with alarm, the enemy hurried a big army to
meet the oncoming Russians. This successfully relieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the rush on the British and French, but at a heavy
cost to Russia. In a very real sense thousands of
Russians then laid down their lives for their friends.
Had they not been idealists and romantics, they could
not have brought themselves to do it, for it requires
a kind of courage differing from every other courage
(and there are ever so many other kinds), deliberately to
face defeat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very soon the Russian Army, completely ready by now
to face their formidable foe, showed how temporary had
been the check her commanders had knowingly courted
and endured.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Russian peasant is noted for his kindness of
heart, and when he becomes a soldier this beautiful human
quality stands him in good stead. In one instance four
classes of the Order of St. George, which is like our
Victoria Cross, were conferred upon a Hussar trooper,
the orderly of a dangerously wounded officer, whom he
rescued amid a hail of shot, and carried four miles. On
the way he evaded numerous patrols of the enemy, and
several times he had to swim broad streams, holding up
the officer as best he could while they were both being
“potted” from the banks.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>We in our country did not know at first of the fine
things being done in Russia. Many people were surprised
to learn, for instance, how very good is the Russian Army
Air Corps.</p>

<p class='c011'>You are of course aware that an airman takes his life
in his hand every time he goes out to observe what is
going on in the enemy’s lines. Putting aside all the
ordinary—they ought to be called the extraordinary—dangers
of air service, there are times when a great deal
may depend on a flying scout being willing to give his
life for his beloved country. How true that is was shown
by a grand exploit performed by Captain Nesteroff, the
Russian Pegoud, one of the first men in Russia to loop
the loop.</p>

<p class='c011'>During a fierce battle with the Austrian troops, Captain
Nesteroff was able to convey information of extreme value
to the Russian commander. He was resting after his
exertions, when he observed two Austrian aeroplanes
making their way towards the Russian positions. Aware
that at the moment of their appearance a strategic move of
the utmost importance to the safety of the Russian Army
was in progress, and that it was absolutely necessary to
prevent information from reaching the enemy, he took
the air and flew towards them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>By skilful manœuvring he succeeded in getting so close
to one of the aeroplanes that he was able to fire his revolver
almost point blank at the pilot. The latter was wounded,
and fell with his machine to the ground, where he was captured.
As soon as he had fired, Captain Nesteroff commenced
a spiral upward flight, and he was at once followed
by the second Austrian airman. Realising that it was,
above all else, necessary to prevent the enemy aeroplane
from returning to the Austrian lines with the valuable
information that he had gathered, Nesteroff nerved himself
for a supreme effort, and launched his aerial craft
full tilt at his foe. The machines came together with a
crash, and descended to the ground interlocked, both the
gallant airmen being killed.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have told you that the Russian peasant has a very
kind heart. Kindness almost always implies sympathy
and understanding. When the first trainload of wounded
Austrians arrived on Russian soil they were treated
at each place the train stopped with wonderful kindness
and sympathy, and one poor woman was seen, while
feeding a young Austrian soldier, to be crying bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” asked one of the doctors.
“Has he insulted or annoyed you in any way?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“No, indeed,” she answered; “I am crying because
I cannot help feeling sorry to see a boy like this all alone
in a foreign country, not even able to say a word in our
language. I am mourning over what his mother must be
feeling now. If you will allow me, I will take him home
with me and nurse him back to health!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet this peasant woman, simple as she may have
been, must have known quite well that Austria has always
had a peculiar dislike, and even contempt, for the Slav
race to which she belonged, and for the sake of which
Russia is at war.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following little story illustrates the same beautiful
qualities of mercy and of kindness, but this time the hero
of it is a soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>An artilleryman’s battery, after hours of hard work,
was at last ordered to retire. As it sullenly retreated, he
saw a baby girl toddle from the doorway of one of the
houses of the village right into the path of the battery.
Amid a rain of shell and shrapnel, this brave fellow went
to the baby’s rescue, while his comrades gave him up for
lost. As he reached the child a shrapnel shell burst overhead,
and, throwing himself down, the man shielded the
child’s body with his own. One bullet passed through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>his back, injuring him so badly that he could not regain
his feet. But two of his comrades immediately went to
his assistance, and carried him, with his little protégée, to
the battery, whence they were removed to hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been said that every country has the Jews it
deserves. Now Jews have never been quite fairly treated
by the Russian Government. But during this war they
have shown themselves to be true patriots and brave
soldiers, and so we may hope that they will be treated
as well as they deserve to be in future.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very early in the campaign a Jewish soldier, named
Pernikow, won the St. George’s Cross for valour.
He was charged with the delivery of important secret
despatches, and, though very seriously wounded on the
way, he struggled on to his journey’s end, and fulfilled
his mission.</p>

<p class='c013'>We must not forget another of our Allies, the country
which Russia regards as her small sister—I mean Serbia.</p>

<p class='c011'>This gallant little country was the greatest help to
the Allies, and especially to Russia. She had by no means
recovered from the terrible Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913,
when Austria fell upon her. But little Serbia not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>drove away the enemy, but herself invaded Austrian
territory. Thus she engaged and defeated large Austrian
forces which would otherwise have been thrown against
Russia.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is the story of a young Serbian officer who at
one time was well known in London and in Paris, for his
father is a diplomatist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Voislav Grashanin was not only a keen
soldier, beloved and honoured by his men, but he was
also a very clever and many-sided man. A comrade
thus described his gallant death:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It fell to our detachment to lead the attack on Iverak
and Golo Tchuk. Grashanin was first in the charge,
and after a fierce tussle he reached the height of Golo
Tchuk and ranged his men quickly in firing order once
more. I saw him passing among the lines, and heard him
say: ‘Now, brothers, show how straight you can aim!
There is glory in store for us here if we know how to take
it. Who cares for life? We’ve all got to die some day!’
Shortly afterwards the enemy began to fall back, and
Grashanin called: ‘What did I tell you? See! A
battery is offered us. A battery of our own. Forward,
and seize their guns!’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Just then he was shot in the right hand. He bound
up the wound where he stood, and lifted the other hand
to give the signal, when that hand, too, was struck by a
bullet. This time the wound was graver, his fingers being
severed. We bound it up for him as well as we could,
for he refused to go to the rear. He had taken off his coat
for the hasty operation, and now the bandages were so
clumsy that he could not pass his arm through the sleeve.
We hung it by one button round his neck, and he went
on giving orders as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We advanced steadily, and again the enemy made a
backward move. Then Voislav shouted, ‘Come on for
the guns!’ At that moment a bullet lodged in his chest.
He fell, but got up again on his knees to command:
‘The guns! Take the guns!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our lieutenant was dead when we brought up the
guns to where he lay. Still, I think he must have heard
our ‘Hurrah!’ when we took the guns. Every man of
us kissed him before we buried him, and we dug him the
deepest grave I have seen in this campaign. We were
very fond of him because of his kind heart and elegant
manner of speech. Some had nicknamed him ‘the
Parisian,’ but he was Serbian to the core.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Among the many changes which this great war
will bring about, it will certainly again make
true Victor Hugo’s touching boast, “Two countries
hath each man—his own and France.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For nearly a thousand years this was true of all the
gentlepeople in our three kingdoms. Scotsmen and Irishmen
might be at daggers drawn with England, but always
they remained not only friendly, but on the closest terms
of intimacy with France. Charming French princesses
married Scottish kings, and you will perhaps remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>that when the great Scots wizard waved his wand, “the
bells would ring in Notre Dame,” not, observe, in Westminster
Abbey or in Old St. Paul’s!</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a Scots College and an Irish College in
Paris, and no one in Scotland and Ireland was reckoned
a scholar unless he had studied in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that England and France were almost always
at war made no difference to this pleasant state of things,
and now we like to remember that the one place where,
till this year, British and French fought side by side, was
in the Holy Land during the Crusades. In old days
wars raged over years, not over weeks or months, and now
and again great stretches of French country belonged to
England. I know a beautiful parish church in the heart
of France which was built by the British in the thirteenth
century—seven hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of you who have learned any history must know
that poor Queen Mary exclaimed that when she died the
word “Calais” would be found graven on her heart, so
deeply had she felt its recapture by the French. Not
long ago, speaking of the Germans’ desperate wish to get
to Calais, a great English writer observed, smiling, “As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to the effect which their occupation of Calais would
produce on this country, they are three hundred years too
late. Calais is not inscribed on the heart of <em>our</em> Queen
Mary!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ill-fortune often brings countries far more closely
together than does good fortune. After the execution of
Charles I, English, Scottish, and Irish loyalists fled to
France, and lived there long years of a not unhappy exile.
Louis XIV gave them a magnificent welcome. He presented
the Stuarts with one of his most comfortable
palaces, one, too, within an easy distance of his own palace
at Versailles; and when you read the enchanting, intimate
letters of Madame de Sévigné to her daughter, you will
see how much the two courts intermingled, and what a
constant coming and going there was from France to
England and from England to France. When Charles II
became king he did not forget his French friends. In
fact I think it may be whispered that he remained far
more of a Parisian than a Londoner, and you will feel
this too if you ever read the letters he wrote to his beloved
sister, the fascinating Henrietta, who had married the
brother of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>England was very English in the eighteenth century,
but, even so, there was constant intercourse between
London and Paris. English names occur almost as often
as French ones in the correspondence of the famous
Madame du Deffand, and the best picture of the French
society of that day is to be found in the letters of
her old friend, Horace Walpole. Marie Antoinette
had many dear English friends, and Englishwomen as
well as Englishmen were made very welcome by her, not
only in the Palace of Versailles, but at her own beloved
Petit Trianon.</p>

<p class='c013'>So close was the tie then between the two countries
that they read as a matter of course each other’s books.
Innumerable little girls in France are now called Clarisse
because of a wonderful story, written by an English bookseller
named Benjamin Richardson, called “Clarissa Harlowe.”
Equally in this country, few, if any, children were
named Clare or Julia before the publication of “La
Nouvelle Héloise,” written by the Jean Jacques Rousseau
to whom I alluded in my first chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'>You might have thought that the great Revolution
would have broken the old connection between the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>countries and the two capitals. So far was this from
being the case that there were many people in England
who sympathised with the aims of the Revolution. Others,
while regarding all that went on in the France of that day
with horror, yet felt their affection for France and the
French people become closer. An affectionate familiarity
between the two countries was further encouraged by
the sudden appearance in England of thousands of French
people, who, known as the Emigrés, were largely composed
of members of the French nobility who had escaped from
France on the eve of the great Revolution. Many of them
lived in England till after the Battle of Waterloo, and our
grandmothers were all taught French, dancing, and the
harp by lady Emigrées.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even the Napoleonic Wars did not really break the
links binding France and England. In some ways they
may even be said to have strengthened them. Not
only were our troops always on the Continent, but
Napoleon occasionally made a great sweep of any
English travellers he could catch, either in France, or in
the countries which he successively conquered. These
unfortunate people were what would now be called
“interned” in various French towns, where in some cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>they were compelled to remain for years. But I am glad
to tell you that these forlorn creatures were treated most
kindly by their French neighbours, and when they finally
came back to England, so fond had they become of France
that some of them used to go back there for two or three
months of each year.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gradually, it is difficult to say why, the two countries
drifted apart. Indeed it began to seem that the nearer they
grew together in a material sense—the less and less time
it took to get from London to Paris, for instance—the less
all that was best in French art and in French life, appealed
to English people.</p>

<p class='c011'>One thing that perhaps made the English nation
distrust the French was France’s constant change of
rulers. After France had had a king for a few years
she would suddenly change about and have a republic;
then would come a king again, another small revolution,
and then an emperor! It was during the reign
of an emperor, Napoleon III, that Paris became for
the first time the playground of Europe, the place where
foreigners went rather to amuse themselves in stupid
ways, instead of to see beautiful things and to meet agreeable
and interesting people.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Then, quite suddenly, there came a terrible day, just
forty-four years ago, when the playground of Europe
became a battle-ground, and when, with surprise and
horror, England saw that the French, busily engaged in
amusing themselves and other people, had entirely neglected
to get ready for the awful thing, War, which had
suddenly come upon them. As a result of this neglect,
Germany, for the first time in their joint history, conquered
France.</p>

<p class='c013'>So easily, so surprisingly quickly, was this conquest
achieved, that it made the Germans get what is vulgarly
called “swelled head.” It also undoubtedly led to their
confident belief that everything must go well with them in
the present war. But France, as Germany now knows to
her bitter cost, had learned her lesson. Without spending
nearly so much time and thought on war, and the terrible
engines of war, as Germany had done for forty years, she
yet prepared quietly and soberly for the big conflict which,
unlike England, she felt quite sure must be coming on
Europe, if only because of the extraordinary preparations
which she noticed her bullying neighbour was continually
making.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>II</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>You may know that the beautiful provinces or counties
of Alsace and of Lorraine were the heavy price France
paid for her defeat at Germany’s hands in 1870. But these
two provinces always remained French at heart, and their
possession by Germany was like an open wound in France’s
side. Small wonder, therefore, that when war was declared
the first thought of the French Government was,
unwisely and imprudently as many people now think, to
throw an army into Alsace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rapture with which the people there welcomed
the French advance was changed into terror when the
fortunes of war brought about a temporary retreat. The
Germans hate these Alsatians, and cruel was the vengeance
they took on them. One terrible example of their revenge
aroused deep feelings of pain and horror all over the
world, the more so that they actually boasted of the act in
the following words:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The German column was passing along a woody
defile, when a little French lad (Französling) belonging
to one of those gymnastic societies which wear tricolour
ribbons (<em>i.e.</em> the Eclaireurs, or Boy Scouts), was caught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and asked whether the French were about. He refused to
give any information. Fifty yards further on a battery
suddenly opened fire from the cover of a wood. The lad
was asked in French if he had known that the enemy was
in the wood. He did not deny it. Then walking with
firm steps to a telegraph post he stood up against it, with
a green vineyard at his back, and received the volley of
the firing party with a proud smile on his face. Infatuated
wretch! It was a pity to see such wasted courage!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But we know that his courage was not wasted, and that
by their ill-advised recital of that little boy’s heroism, the
Germans inspired innumerable Frenchmen, and Frenchwomen
too, to show themselves even braver and more fearless
for love of country than they might otherwise have done.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was near a town called Nancy that there took place
a touching incident two days after the outbreak of war.</p>

<p class='c011'>A French detachment came into contact with German
troops; soon the Germans retired, leaving behind them
a young wounded officer. The French soldiers picked
him up, and behaved, as I am glad to say our allies always
do behave to their wounded enemy, not only with mercy
but with kindness. He was, however, dying, and his
last words were, “Thank you, gentlemen. I have done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>my duty. I have served my country, as you are serving
yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This young officer was Lieutenant Baron von Marschall,
son of the late Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, who for
a few months was German Ambassador in London. He
had been, till a few days before the declaration of war,
a happy and popular Rhodes Scholar at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c013'>Duty must have been one of Nelson’s favourite words,
for not only did he signal the word in his immortal
message, “England expects every man to do his duty,”
but the last words he ever spoke were, “I have done
my duty; I praise God for it.” The French have some
fine sayings concerning duty. Of these the oldest and the
finest is, “Fais le droit, advienne que pourra.” “Do
thy duty whatever may happen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in Lorraine that Georges André—one of France’s
most famous runners, who is also a Rugby Internationalist,
and scored against both England and Ireland in last
season’s matches—won the Médaille Militaire (the French
Victoria Cross). André, with his company, was surrounded
by a large German detachment in a small village.
They fought like lions, and he himself at last captured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the enemy’s standard, regaining the French lines under a
hail of bullets.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have seen how the German Commander on the fall
of Liège handed General Leman back his sword. Much
about the same time that this was occurring in Belgium,
a similar incident, on a humbler scale, was happening in
Alsace.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Uhlan patrol was surprised by French soldiers.
They all took to their heels save one, who fought magnificently
until finally overpowered by force of numbers.
His French captors, much to his surprise (for the German
soldiers had been told the infamous lie that the British
and French gave no quarter to the wounded), shook him
warmly by the hand, exclaiming, “Tu es un chic type!”
a meed of praise which it is impossible to translate.
They also showed their admiration of his pluck in a more
practical manner, for though they were short of food
themselves they supplied him with food and drink before
he was taken to the General Quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>One likes to remember that in no great war have men
had the monopoly of gallant deeds. In this book you
have read, and will read, of many such performed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>women. A lady can no longer defend a castle, as was
done in mediæval Christendom by so many great-hearted
wives whose husbands were away fighting. But she can
risk her life, and lose it too, for her country, as the
following pathetic story proves:</p>

<p class='c011'>Madame Favre-Schwarz, of Basle, a young and beautiful
French lady, married to one of the richest merchants
in Alsace, was executed after a court-martial very early in
the war. She had attempted to blow up an important
tunnel on the line of the Rhine near Leopoldshöhe, in
order to hinder the advance of German troops towards
her beloved country. Madame Schwarz met her death
bravely, and shouted “Vive la France!” as she fell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this war is ended, and indeed during the conduct
of this war, I hope that no one will ever again sneer at
a woman merely for being a woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Splendid work has been done to help the men at the
front by the women of each of the countries—those of
our enemies as well as in our own and those of our allies—during
the course of this awful struggle. I was told by
a wounded soldier, to whom I had the privilege of talking
in a London hospital, that what struck him most during
the first terrific battles in which he took part, was the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>in which Frenchwomen of all ages, from aged crones to
little girls, came into the trenches under fire with fruit
and water. This was a true errand of mercy, for during
the earlier part of the war the heat was terrible, and our
soldiers suffered awfully from thirst.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the enemy entered Soissons the Mayor of the
town had already left it. Accordingly, a certain Madame
Macherez, the widow of a former Senator—or, as we
should say, of a former member of the French House of
Lords—informed the Commander that she was quite
ready to take over the government of Soissons.</p>

<p class='c011'>He assented, and at once she took charge of the police,
of the fire station, and of the hospital. She “ran” the
town most successfully, and that though the German
Commander began by making enormous demands on the
unfortunate citizens. He asked for nearly 200,000 pounds
(weight) of food, including preserved meats, smoked
sausages, and flour, and 40,000 pounds (weight) of tobacco,
adding the significant threat that if all this were not at
once forthcoming Soissons would be burnt to the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Madame Macherez bluntly told him that it would be
just as reasonable for him to ask for the sun and the moon
as for all these things. She offered, however, to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>what she could, and not only was her offer accepted, but
the town was spared the dreadful fate which befell many
places in the North of France.</p>

<p class='c011'>We can easily imagine this brave woman’s joy when,
a few days later, the same troops who had behaved in an
arrogant, if not in a barbarous, manner passed in full
retreat through Soissons!</p>

<p class='c013'>The French have a peculiar, passionate love for their
flag—the Revolutionary tricolor which banished the old
lilies of France and under which Napoleon led his soldiers
from victory to victory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very early in this war a light infantry regiment, closely
engaged by the enemy, saw over twenty men who in turn
held the standard cut down; a fresh soldier immediately
grasped the coveted trophy and held it aloft, while his
comrades ringed him round with dead. So it went on
until supports arrived, and the standard and the little
remnant of gallant men were saved.</p>

<p class='c013'>I must tell you what a London lady did to cheer and
encourage the young men who were eagerly joining the
colours. She lives in a street where recruits are constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>passing, and she felt sad to see how weary they often looked,
and what little notice passers-by took of them. She therefore
bought a large Union Jack, and whenever a contingent
of recruits marched by she hurried to her front door and
waved the flag, thus showing them that there was at least
one person there who wished to do them a little honour
and felt gratitude for what they were doing for England.
In due course she was rewarded, for an officer, before then
quite unknown to her, called specially to tell her how much
his men had been cheered and touched by her action.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time before the British airmen’s daring raid
into Germany, two French flyers, Lieutenant Cesari and
Corporal Prudhomme, performed a magnificent exploit
over Metz.</p>

<p class='c011'>They left Verdun under orders to reconnoitre and
destroy if possible the Zeppelin sheds at Metz. The two
airmen flew over the line of forts, the lieutenant at about
8000 feet up, and the corporal at 6500. In the midst of a
cloud of bursting projectiles they kept on their way, but
a little before they arrived above the parade ground the
lieutenant’s motor suddenly stopped!</p>

<p class='c011'>Determined not to descend without having accomplished
the task assigned to him, he proceeded to volplane,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and it was in planing that he launched his bomb at the
shed. A little later, much to his surprise, for he had
given himself up for lost, his motor re-started. Corporal
Prudhomme also dropped a bomb from his machine. On
their return journey hundreds of shells were fired at them,
but they reached headquarters safe and sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>A French aviator is reported to have brought down
from the skies a German rifle bullet which he had caught
in his hand! He was flying at a height of about 7000
feet, when he suddenly became aware of a small black
object close to his head. He thought it was an insect of
some kind, and was enough of an entomologist to realise
that a flying insect at such a height was a curiosity.
So he stretched out his hand and grasped what to his
amazement proved to be a bullet! It was evidently a
rifle bullet that had been fired almost vertically, and had
there reached its utmost elevation.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been said that this great war has been waged in
a very pitiless manner, but there have been, as we have
seen, merciful exceptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of these was the reconciliation on the battlefield
between a French and a German soldier, who lay wounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>and abandoned near the little town of Blâmont. They
were there all through the cold, dark night, with only
the dead about them. When dawn came they began to
talk to one another, and the Frenchman gave his water-bottle
to the German. The German sipped a little, and
then kissed the hand of the man who had been his enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There will be no war in Heaven,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>Boys, as we know, have played a splendid part in the
war. One of the bravest French lads, whose name I am
sorry I cannot tell you, saved the town in which he lived
from total destruction, and from French shells.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was at Montmirail, where the German Headquarters
Staff was for a few brief hours installed in the château of
the Duc de la Rochefoucauld. When the first French
shell burst, the Germans did not wait for a second; they
quickly cleared out. But of this retreat the French could
not know anything, so they went on firing. It was then
that a brave lad, in order to save the castle, took his bicycle
and rode out with the shells shrieking above his head to
inform the battery that the enemy had fled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Surprise was felt in our country when it was heard
that quite young German boys were in the firing line, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in the great American Civil War there were lads as young
as thirteen and fourteen, fighting. One of them, called
John Rhea, performed an act of extraordinary bravery
during the retreat from Fishing Creek. He recognised
in a prostrate figure on the ground an old school friend,
named Sam Cox. Although he knew that he faced almost
certain death by trying to help the wounded lad, he bent
down, managed somehow to get him on his back, and
carried him into safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here let me break off to tell you that German boys
have not been backward in helping their beloved country.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of August, Prince Leopold of Bavaria,
who is thirteen years old, placed himself at the head of a
corps of schoolboys, who not only helped to get in the
harvest, but did other useful work.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most remarkable dogs in the world is a
French dog. His name is Tom (a very favourite name
for a dog in France), and he has been trained to help
the wounded by carrying their caps to the Ambulance
Corps. He never touches a dead man.</p>

<p class='c011'>A certain French soldier was struck by a fragment of
shell in the arm. With a bullet in his jaw as well, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>a sabre cut over the head, the wounded man was
lying terribly alone amid a little heap of his fallen
comrades, when he felt a light touch on his forehead.
It was Tom.</p>

<p class='c011'>The soldier knew that the dog was trained to carry
to the camp the cap of every wounded man he found, but
alas! the soldier had lost his. “Run along, Tom. Go
and find my comrades. Get along and find them!” Tom
understood. He dashed away to the camp, ran about
among the men, pulling at their capes and barking, and
succeeded in drawing two ambulance men to the spot
where the wounded man was lying.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think the story of French pluck which has touched
me most was that of Denise Cartier, the little girl who
was so terribly injured in one of the German bomb attacks
on Paris. The first words which Denise said to the policeman
who lifted her up after the explosion were, “<span lang="fr">Surtout
ne dites pas à maman que c’est grave.</span>” (“Above all,
don’t tell mother that it’s serious.”)</p>

<p class='c011'>But alas! her mother had soon to know the worst, for
brave little Denise had to have her leg cut off. When she
awoke after the operation, she found by her bedside a pile
of most beautiful presents sent her by kindly Parisians who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>had heard of her misfortune. Among them was a gold
medal, and what do you think was engraved on it? Her
own brave words to the policeman, “<span lang="fr">Surtout ne dites
pas à maman que c’est grave.</span>”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c015'>Before going back to the fighting line, and especially
before taking leave of our ally, France, I want to tell you
of what was, perhaps, the bitterest blow suffered by her
in the early weeks of the war.</p>

<p class='c011'>That blow was the bombardment of Rheims Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c013'>Round Rheims are the most famous vineyards in
France. All the little hills are covered with grape-laden
vines, and when the writer was in that lovely, peaceful
province of the Marne two years ago, all the happy
peasant people, men, women, and little children, were
gathering in the fruit, singing and laughing as they
went along the narrow, fragrant pathways cut through
the vines.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rheims is a beautiful city, as old as France herself.
Once more, as in 1870, fierce fighting was taking place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>there at the time of the grape harvest, recalling the fine
lines of Bret Harte:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let me of my heart take counsel;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>War is not of life the sum;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who shall stay and reap the harvest</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When the autumn days shall come?</div>
      <div class='line in6'>But the drum</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Echoed, ‘Come!</div>
      <div class='line'>Death shall reap the braver harvest,’ said the solemn-sounding drum.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And death did reap a brave harvest amid the vineyards
of France. Not a human harvest alone, but one
composed of cherished memories—memories composed of
all the French nation holds dear in its glorious, shadowy
past. Memories of every figure in the magnificent procession
of France’s kings and queens, of her saints, her statesmen,
her warriors—especially of Joan of Arc, the beloved
warrior-maid. The Cathedral of Rheims was not only
the most perfect building of its kind in Europe—it was
the Westminster Abbey of France, respected by her enemies
for a thousand years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rheims has been sung by many poets, but perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the most beautiful lines on the cathedral were written by
James Russell Lowell:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I stood before the triple northern port,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where dedicated shapes of saints and kings,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stern faces bleared with immemorial watch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looked down benignly grave and seemed to say,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Ye come and go incessant; we remain</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Safe in the hallowed quiets of the past;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Be reverent, ye who flit and are forgot,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Of faith so nobly realised as this.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was with a feeling of amazement as well as of horror
that one September day the world learnt of the bombardment
of Rheims Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c013'>The interior of the great church had been filled with
wounded, most of them, be it noted, German, and a large
Red Cross had been hung out from one of the towers.
When the bombardment began, an effort was made to
move these poor soldiers out, but they were lying on straw,
the straw caught fire, and several of the people in the
cathedral were killed by the German shells, including four
Sisters of Mercy. Much of the floor became thickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>littered with the stained glass, which fell in showers out
of the great windows, six hundred years old, which were,
perhaps, the chief glory of the Cathedral. To add to the
horror of the scene the wounded, terrified by the sight
of flames and smoke, began trying painfully to drag themselves
out of danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the unhappy German wounded appeared at the
great doors, which someone had already flung open, there
rose from the townspeople assembled outside a hoarse,
insistent cry of “Kill them! Kill them!” For some of
those in the crowd unjustly suspected these men of having
set the cathedral on fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a while it looked as if the German prisoners
would be massacred, but at the critical moment the Abbé
Andrieux, a gentle, quiet little priest, sprang forward,
placing himself with outstretched arms before the great
doors. Behind him pressed forward the terrified wounded,
standing, crouching, and crawling—their one thought to
escape the fire, smoke, and falling glass and masonry
inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stand back! Don’t fire!” shouted the Abbé
“If you kill them you will be far more guilty than
they!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashamed, the crowd shrank back. But they went on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>hissing and hooting while their enemies were carried to
shelter close by.</p>

<p class='c013'>The present writer is almost as grieved at the injury
which was also done to the ancient Church of Saint
Rémy, at Rheims, which is a hundred years older than
the cathedral. It had already been built some time
when Joan of Arc was born at Domrémy, the little
village on the Upper Meuse, which was, in a sense, the
creation of the Abbé and monks of St. Rémy of Rheims.
The Abbé had a very kindly feeling for Domrémy, and
he generously gave Joan’s father, Jacques d’Arc, a patent
exempting the village from all taxes and tribute. This
exemption was maintained until the French Revolution.
In the registers kept by the tax-gatherers the blank space
opposite the name of this parish was quaintly inscribed
year after year, and century after century, “On Account
of The Maid.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the bombardment, the people of Rheims kept
up their courage, and that even when they had to live for
many days in their cellars. An Englishman had a talk
with one old French gentleman in a cellar dwelling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The one thing that keeps us going,” he said, “is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>my wag of a son, my seventh, for every time a shell falls,
or bursts over the house-tops, he makes some fresh joke,
the young beggar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And where are your other six sons?” his English
acquaintance inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are all at the front, and I’ve heard from them
too. They are as happy as happy can be, for, you see,
Monsieur, we are daily gaining ground.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This little anecdote will make you understand the great
outstanding fact about France. It is that every one of
her sons is, will be, or has been, a soldier! During the
course of a great war, it is a splendid, inspiring thought
that the whole manhood of a nation is in arms to defend
her. No need of recruiting there—no need to remind the
young men that their country needs them. The French
soldier is the French Everyman.</p>

<p class='c013'>In old days I often felt pained to hear English people, just
returned from a holiday in France, smile—even jeer—at the
rough, often unsmart, look of the French soldier. These
same people do not smile and jeer now when they watch
a rough, unsmart detachment of young Englishmen
marching to their drilling ground. They are touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and thrilled—or if they are not, they ought to be. You
cannot have smart uniforms when every man over eighteen
and under fifty is a soldier—or if you do, you sacrifice
the rest of the nation, as we now know Germany has
done, to the awful, sinister War god, the evil genius who
lies in wait for happy, peaceful, busy countries, which only
arm, as France had done, not for attack, but for defence.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>You will remember I told you that long before
this great war Belgium had already been called
for hundreds of years “the Cockpit of Europe.”
This vivid phrase comes down to us from the time when
cock-fighting was a favourite sport among Englishmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Belgium was indeed the pit in which the gamecocks
of many nations—the Flemings, the Dutch, the Spanish,
the English, and the French—battled furiously. There
is no town, and there is scarcely a village, the name of
which is not proudly borne by some regiment among
its battle honours. From the British point of view the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>most memorable of these are Quatre Bras, Ramillies, and
Waterloo.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most famous, I need hardly tell you, is the Battle
of Waterloo, which was fought within a few miles of Brussels,
the capital of Belgium. That was one reason why a
great many English-speaking and English-reading people
all over the world felt very sad when they heard that the
German Army was in Brussels. But there is another
reason why many men and women who have never been
there feel a familiar and affectionate interest in the town.
That is because three of our greatest writers and romancers
have chosen to lay scenes of their stories in Brussels.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first of these was Laurence Sterne, of whose most
famous character, Uncle Toby, I have told you.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second was William Makepeace Thackeray. He
showed an intimate knowledge of the Brussels of a hundred
years ago in his account in “Vanity Fair” of what took
place there before, during, and after the Battle of Waterloo.
But those who claim to be true Thackerayans will tell you
that even finer, even more firmly fixed on their minds, is
the account of Esmond’s visit to his mother’s grave in the
Brussels of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>It was, however, a lady, Miss Charlotte Brontë, who,
in “Villette,” which good judges consider the best of
her stories, has made many of us feel really intimate with
the highways and byways of Brussels. In fact, it is not
too much to say that there are many people (the writer
among them) who, when before the War they heard
the name of Brussels suddenly pronounced, immediately
thought of “Villette.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In every war certain men seize on what is called the
popular imagination. Three such soon towered above all
their fellows in Belgium.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first was King Albert, who has shown himself the
heroic defender of his kingdom’s rights and liberties, and
who continually shared in the trenches the dangers and
discomforts of his brave troops.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second was General Leman, whose name will
ever be linked with the magnificent defence of Liège.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the third was Adolphe Max, the Mayor or Burgomaster
of Brussels. This civilian hero might well take
as his motto, “Peace hath her victories as well as war,”
for his extraordinary moral and physical courage saved
his beloved city from the fate which befell Louvain and
Termonde.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>When the Germans were about to make their triumphal
march through the Belgian capital, the Mayor insisted
that as he was the First Citizen of Brussels he must ride
at the head of the procession. In this way he proved
that he was not the captive but the host of the rough
intruders. And when the German General Staff arrived
at the Town Hall, and, declaring that they meant to
make it their Headquarters, commanded M. Max to provide
them at once with three hundred beds, “I will provide
three hundred and <em>one</em> beds,” replied the Mayor of Brussels,
smiling, “for of course <em>I</em> shall sleep here too!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will hand over to us a hundred of your notables
as hostages for your people’s good behaviour,” said the
German General. “I will be your hostage,” instantly
replied M. Max, “and I will provide you with none
other.” Small wonder that this brave, good-humoured
man won the love as well as the respect of the people
of whom he was the shepherd.</p>

<p class='c011'>On one occasion the German General, trying to
threaten and bully M. Max, laid his revolver on the table
with what he apparently thought was a grand gesture. M.
Max, with a smile, took up his pen and laid it beside the
revolver. And never was there a better example shown
of the fact that the pen can be mightier than the sword.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>At last, as punishment for his sturdy courage and
his determination to protect his people’s legal rights, M.
Max was suspended from his office, and put in what the
enemy quaintly called “honourable custody” in a German
fortress. Fierce were the grief and anger of the unfortunate
inhabitants of Brussels, and the Germans soon found
that it was far more difficult to govern the city in the
absence, than with the help, of M. Max.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Germans had not been at Brussels very long
when it became known that British Marines had been
landed at Ostend. They only stayed there a short time,
but their temporary presence was a great comfort to the
poor Belgians.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ostend was then simply a pretty watering-place, but that
was not always so. The town whose name, as you will
see later, was to become a familiar one in this great war,
was once besieged by the Spaniards for three and a half
years, and it was said that the noise of the bombardment
was heard in London! It was at Ostend that the Duke
of Wellington, then plain Arthur Wellesley, first set foot
on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early in the War Ostend became a place of desolation
and distress, for the unfortunate Belgians, when fleeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>from their burnt towns and villages, naturally made for
the sea. There was no room in the town to lodge them
all, and many of them lived for quite a long time in bathing-machines
on the beach. It was mostly from Ostend
that the Belgian refugees embarked to find kind new friends
and homes in England.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the Germans marched on Brussels King Albert
and his brave Queen had left for Antwerp, the beautiful
old city and port which was, till this war, regarded as one
of the best fortified strongholds in Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The King and Queen, together with their little children,
had not been there many days when one night the enemy
basely sent a huge Zeppelin airship over the town. It
tried to drop bombs over the Palace, where the Royal
family were sleeping, but, missing the mark, only destroyed
a small house, in which, however, a young mother
and her tiny baby were killed. This cruel and unwarlike
act shocked and disgusted all civilised people. But it
seems to have delighted the Germans, who loudly proclaimed
that London would be the next city visited.
It is, however, a curious fact that during the first three
months of the War no Zeppelin flew over French territory,
although in this way a great deal of legitimate damage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>might have been done, not to women and children, but
to soldiers and stores of arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time that I am writing, no Zeppelin has yet flown
over London, but from the first day of the War a great
many sensible people fully expected that the enemy would
send one of these enormous aircraft over to England, if
only to surprise and terrify us.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now a Zeppelin is a most wonderful thing, and for
my part I should very much like to see one. The day
may come when we shall journey by air as easily as by
road or rail, and in Germany for some time past anyone
could take a short trip in a Zeppelin by paying a comparatively
small sum.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have already told you that it is a foolish thing to
underrate an enemy; it is also a rather mean thing to do.
Let us, therefore, give all honour to Count Zeppelin,
even if he has allowed his invention to be turned to a
despicable and inhuman use.</p>

<p class='c013'>This remarkable man, like most inventors, was regarded
for a long time as a dreamer, even as a madman. Undeterred
by this mortifying fact, he worked on and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>till at last he produced the airship which was known as
Zeppelin I. It was not, however, till Zeppelin III, just
seven years ago, made a successful flight, that the German
Government agreed to purchase the ship, and further
granted him a good sum of money in order that he might
carry on his experiments. In the year following, in
1908, a much larger sum was given to Count Zeppelin,
and he found himself, from being an obscure inventor,
suddenly raised to a pinnacle as the most belauded man
in his Fatherland!</p>

<p class='c013'>When this war broke out the Germans undoubtedly
counted immensely on their fleet of Zeppelins. But,
fortunately for those of us who live in London, a Zeppelin
is so huge and unwieldy that it can only be started with
considerable difficulty, and it cannot alight and fly up
again as can an aeroplane. Moreover, it requires an enormous
shed for its protection when it is not in the air,
for on land it is a very helpless machine. Once in flight,
however, it is a most formidable-looking engine of war.
It has been said that if a Zeppelin were stood on end by
St. Paul’s, it would appear at least a third longer than
that vast building.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>To return to Antwerp. The city has long been dear
to many English people, and it is very easily reached
from our shores. Perhaps that is one reason why it
has been a favourite holiday place for a great many
years. When the news came that it was to be fiercely
attacked by the enemy, a wave of sorrow swept through
our country.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a beautiful town, and the steeple of the Cathedral
is so exquisite, so delicately lovely in design, as to have
become one of the wonders of the world. Napoleon,
who was not apt to admire fine architecture, said it
was like a piece of old Mechlin lace. Antwerp is a
city of churches, and in each church there are wonderful
paintings, many of them the work of men born in the
city itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most delightful of Flemish painters was Quentin
Matsys. He began life as a blacksmith, and the city
possesses some fine ironwork done by him in youth.
Fortunately for the world, he fell in love with an artist’s
daughter. The artist would not give his daughter to a
blacksmith, and declared that she <em>must</em> marry a painter.
So Quentin Matsys immediately began to paint, and he
very soon painted much better than his future father-inlaw!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>In the Cathedral is a tablet to his memory on which
are inscribed the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Twas love connubial taught the smith to paint.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Antwerp has always been one of the fighting fortresses
of the world. We must, however, remember that it was
far easier to defend the little old Antwerp of the Middle
Ages than the big modern city.</p>

<p class='c011'>I think the most interesting thing about the Antwerp
of the past is that Godfrey de Bouillon, of whom I am sure
some of you must have heard, started from there for the
Holy Land, where he was to die bearing the fine title of
“Baron and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Antwerp went through many terrible trials before this
last siege—in fact, so cruelly was it treated about five
hundred years ago that the episode still lives in history
as “the Spanish Fury.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the middle of the French Revolution Antwerp
became French. Napoleon delighted in its possession,
and uttered the famous words, “Antwerp is a pistol
aimed at the heart of England!” He found it, however,
as we believe the Germans will find it, of as little or of
as much use as an unloaded pistol; and in due course he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>had to give it up, just as the Germans will have to give
it up.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is strange now to reflect that a British Army besieged
Antwerp in 1814, when it was splendidly defended by
the French.</p>

<p class='c013'>War is full of curious, funny, and terrible incidents.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before Antwerp surrendered to the enemy, everything
was destroyed that could possibly be of any use to the
German hosts. Among other things so treated were
hundreds of motor-cars. Some, of course, had seen a
good deal of service and were old, but there were some
splendid new ones too. An energetic Belgian officer
had them all brought together in a square, and then he
set strong men, including as many blacksmiths as he was
able to find, to carry out the job of putting the motors out
of action. They fell to their work of destruction with a
will, puncturing tires, hammering cylinders, and wrenching
gears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tons and tons of excellent corn were also emptied out
into the river, and the cold-storage apparatus of the
town, which enabled meat and all perishable foods to
be kept for an indefinite time, was also destroyed. All
the ships in the fine harbour were made useless by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>boilers being smashed up. Thus, when the Germans
walked in expecting to find everything nice and comfortable,
they discovered that the town was but an
empty husk.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Germans began to bombard Antwerp on the
second day of October, and they took the city solely
because they had better and bigger guns than the defenders.
The Belgians, headed by their splendid King,
put up a valiant fight, and England sent a party of British
Naval Volunteers to help in the defence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now very few people know about the British Naval
Volunteers. They are a fine force, dating from the
reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is a curious fact that
Antwerp saw them for the first time under fire since the
Napoleonic scare, which frightened quiet folk in England
so very much more than the Kaiser with all his legions
and terrifying threats has been able to do! It is, therefore,
the more creditable that our officers and men acquitted
themselves so excellently, showing remarkable firmness,
discipline, and courage, and that though some of these
Naval Volunteers had only been in training a very short
time.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Antwerp fell, some people regretted that this British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>force had been sent there. But they were wrong in so
regretting. The presence of these volunteers heartened
the defence, and in such a case as that we should all feel:</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>How long will the War last? No two people
agree about this, and that however wise, however
clever, even however experienced in war they
may be. It will be very interesting to see who among our
friends have proved right; those who say it will be over
soon, or those others who believe it may last years.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is one thing, however, about which even now
we all are agreed. This is that, however long the war may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>last, Britain and her Allies will never give up the fight
until victory is assured.</p>

<p class='c013'>This great war has been full of surprises, which soldiers
and historians will go on discussing for many years to
come. Never before, as I have already explained, had
such vast masses of men been engaged, never before had
battle fronts extended for two hundred, and even three
hundred, miles. Not so very long ago, battles never took
more than a week or ten days at the most before what
soldiers call a “decision” was reached. By “decision,”
soldiers mean the complete defeat of one army or the
other, so that it is unable to gather itself together
and fight again. Even the Battle of the Aisne, which
was really a row of battles on a line as long as from
London to Carlisle, did not produce a decision of
that kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without going into a long explanation which you
might not be able to understand, I will try to show
how the Battle of the Aisne simply did not end at all, but
gradually melted, so to speak, into what we may call the
Battle of the Dykes.</p>

<p class='c011'>One great reason for this singular result, or absence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>result, is to be found in the use of aircraft. In the Italian
War in Tripoli, and in the Balkan War, aeroplanes had done
good service, but this was the first occasion on which they
had been employed on a great scale, and the effect of their
employment was that neither side could prepare those
surprises for the enemy which, in old days, brought
about decisive victories.</p>

<p class='c011'>Napoleon used always to feel by means of scouts for
the point at which his enemy was weakest, and against
that point he would throw his whole strength. But if
Napoleon were alive now, he could not wage war in that
way. It is true that his aeroplanes would find out the
enemy’s weak point quickly, but the enemy, in his
turn, would quickly find out where Napoleon was
bringing up fresh men, and would make arrangements
to meet them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is the sort of thing that happened on the Aisne.
Both sides pushed hard, and there was terrible loss of
life in numerous battles along the whole front. Villages
were taken and retaken, sometimes five or six times over,
and on the whole the Allies gained a good deal of ground,
and to that extent they defeated the enemy, to whom it
was very important to get on quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>England and France were not in such a hurry. They
could afford to wait because fresh troops were constantly
coming up, not only French, but also British, including
the magnificent Indian regiments, while the New Army
enlisted on the appeal of Lord Kitchener, and the Canadian
and the Australian forces, were steadily forming and
training, ready to be thrown into the battle. It was
quite enough for the Allies simply to hold the Germans,
and prevent them from getting to Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is reason to believe that the German generals,
and the Kaiser in particular, determined at this crisis to
make a great dash for the coast. If you look at the map
you will see that on the Belgian coast, going westwards
beyond Ostend, we come to Dunkirk, in France; and
then, still further on, to Calais.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calais has had such a long and romantic history that
I cannot help being glad that it has played a part in this
great war. The people of Calais are as brave now as they
were in the days when the burghers, themselves behaving
nobly, gave, as the doing of a noble action nearly always
does, the opportunity for the performance of another.
Long before the Kaiser set his heart on occupying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the nearest port to England, mighty warriors had fought
for Calais.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A thousand knights have reined their steeds</div>
      <div class='line'>To watch this line of sand-hills run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Along the never silent Strait,</div>
      <div class='line'>To Calais glittering in the sun;</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To look towards Ardres’ golden field</div>
      <div class='line'>Across the wide aerial plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which glows as if the Middle Age</div>
      <div class='line'>Were gorgeous upon earth again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Kaiser wanted to get to Calais for two reasons;
one was to encourage the people in Berlin, and the second
object was to frighten people here, in England, and to attack
the British warships with submarines and destroyers,
working from the harbour of Calais.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a very disagreeable surprise awaited the Germans
when they threw themselves towards the coast. This
surprise was a number of British and French warships,
which shelled them from the sea!</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the British ships were three very strange-looking
craft called monitors. You know well what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>a monitor means at school, though in some schools
they are called prefects. The word exactly means a
person who advises, and to whose words attention must
be paid.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Germans certainly had to pay attention to the
observations of the three British monitors. These ships,
named the Humber, Severn, and Mersey, are like nothing
else in the Navy—I can only compare them to floating
fortresses. Everything else is sacrificed in building them
to having on board as big guns as possible. They are
therefore shaped rather like barges, so that they may
stand the violent shock when their big guns are all fired.
Their speed is not great, and they do not lie deep in the
water, so that they can come very near the coast. They
are, indeed, meant entirely for coast defence.</p>

<p class='c011'>These three curious-looking ships were being built
in this country for Brazil, and our Admiralty very cleverly
took possession of them, of course paying the full price,
and very useful they turned out in this Battle of the
Dykes.</p>

<p class='c011'>You can easily understand that the German trenches
and other positions had to be mostly, not alongside the
coastline, but at right angles to it, so that the monitors
could fire their shells lengthwise at the doomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Germans, and so they killed many more than they would
otherwise have done.</p>

<p class='c013'>The country in which the battle was fought is covered
with little rivers and canals and dykes, and that is why
I have called it the Battle of the Dykes. Parts of it also
were flooded, and the German advance became extremely
difficult. The British destroyers used to run up the
rivers and canals and shell any German position which
had escaped the shells of the monitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The loss of life was terrible, and not on the German
side only. The gallant Belgian Army, though a good deal
diminished in numbers, fought magnificently. The
Germans, however, continually brought up fresh troops,
regardless of the terrible slaughter. And there came a
day at the end of October when the Belgian forces
found that they were running short of cartridges and
shells. It was then that the Germans had their great
chance, but for some extraordinary reason they missed it.
If they had pressed on, they must have driven their
enemy before them and obtained an important success.
Instead of that, to the astonishment and delight of
the Belgians, they actually fell back, and the golden
opportunity was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>What a lesson this is in the value of perseverance!
The Romans had an excellent proverb, namely, “Opportunity
is bald behind”; meaning that when you
have once allowed your chance to pass you, there
is nothing by which you can catch hold of it to drag
it back.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may have heard the expression “the romance of
war.” Even in this awful conflict, where there has been so
much that was frightful, certain romantic facts have come
to cheer the heart of the nation. Thus, under Rear-Admiral
Horace Hood, who commanded the flotilla off
the Belgian coast, was Commander Charles Fremantle.
They are both descended from heroes of the Napoleonic
wars. A Fremantle commanded a line of battleships at
Copenhagen and Trafalgar. It was Viscount Hood who,
in 1759, destroyed the transports which had been got
ready by the daring of the French for the invasion of
England. Another Hood served with Nelson in the
Mediterranean; this was Samuel Hood. His elder
brother, Alexander, commanded the Mars, which fought
a duel with the French warship Hercule, and he died
of his wounds just as the sword of the French captain
was placed in his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The British Army never fought more bravely, more
doggedly, and with more splendid cheerfulness than
during this fierce, water-logged battle. The enemy, even
with his great advantage in numbers and in weight of
artillery, was no match for our men. The London
Scottish, the first complete unit of our Territorial Army
to fight by the side of Regulars, covered themselves with
glory by magnificent charges, again and again repeated,
at a place called Messines. It was at this time, too, that
the Indian troops first came into action, with terrible
results for the Germans.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is difficult to select what to tell you about the Indians,
there is so much that is curious and interesting. What
struck me personally most was the fact that their batteries
of mountain guns and Maxims, according to an
observer who saw them in their French camp, are
carried on mule-back. Being in Europe has made no
difference at all to these wonderful people’s immemorial
traditions. Thus, they have brought all their food from
India, and they live when on foreign soil exactly as
their ancestors lived. There are thousands of goats in
the Sikh lines, and very well they bore the long journey
from India.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Some of the Indian troops cannot eat any food over
which has passed even the shadow of a person belonging
to another religious creed. Some of the Indians, also,
can only take their food separately, and as it were in
secret. But, with the help of the native officers and of
white officers who had served in India, such difficulties
were easily met, and these gallant Sikhs, Rajputs, Gurkhas,
and Pathans suffered no injury to their religious faith,
while at the same time they fought shoulder to shoulder
with their white comrades in defence of the British Empire.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a great mistake to suppose that the enemy
was content only to fight in the cockpit of Europe. The
far-flung battle line reached at last from Belgium to
Switzerland, something like three hundred miles, and all
along there was constant fighting. The struggle swayed
backwards and forwards—indeed, for weeks it seemed
like a joust between two determined wrestlers, each of
whom, if he gave way an inch one day, got back an inch
the next.</p>

<p class='c013'>Particularly violent was the struggle round and for
Arras. This quaint town has been described as the most
picturesque in Northern Europe. This was partly owing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>to the fact that it still retained great traces of the old Spanish
occupation. One square in Arras looked as if it had been
lifted bodily out of Spain. Like so many north of France
and Belgian towns, it also had a singularly beautiful town
hall and belfry. Alas! all this beauty, including the little
Spanish square, was bombarded and destroyed. But, sad
as was the fate of Arras, it was shared by many other
historic towns.</p>

<p class='c013'>All along the battle line deeds of valour, of daring,
and of quiet, unostentatious heroism were daily performed.
Many of our soldiers and airmen earned not
only the Legion of Honour, but the Médaille Militaire,
which is only awarded for deeds of exceptional daring
performed on active service.</p>

<p class='c013'>Private F. W. Dodson, of Meadowwell, North Shields,
serving with the 2nd Coldstream Guards, was recommended
for the V.C. for saving a wounded comrade
under fire. When writing to his wife on their wedding
anniversary an account of what had happened he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will know by the time you receive this that I
have been recommended for the V.C., an honour I never
thought would come my way. I only took my chance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>and did my duty to save my comrade. It was really
nothing, but I shall never forget the congratulations and
praise I received from our officers, my comrades, and
our Brigadier-General. I shall ever remember them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Dodson must have been a proud woman when
she read this modest, manly letter, as also when she received
yet another letter from the wife of her husband’s
commanding officer, Captain Follett. Lady Mildred
Follett sent her the following extract from a letter received
from her husband:</p>

<p class='c011'>“A thick fog came down, so I sent a group of three
men out 100 yards to our front to warn us of an attack
from the enemy. After they had been there an hour, the
fog suddenly lifted, and they were fired on at close range
by the Germans. One man was killed, one was wounded
badly, and one crawled back. I didn’t know how to get
the wounded man back, so I had to call for a volunteer,
and a reservist, Dodson, at once responded, and went out
and fetched him. He was heavily fired at, but not hit.
He is quite all right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is comforting to know that the bravest, even the most
reckless, men constantly have marvellous escapes. Take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>the case of Lieutenant A. C. Johnston, the Hampshire
county cricketer. The day before he was wounded, the
nose of a shell hit a wall six inches above his head. Shortly
after that a bullet hit the ground half a yard in front of him,
bounded up, and hit him on the body, bruising his ribs.
Then a bullet hit him over the heart, but was “spent”
before reaching him. Finally, while he was sitting on the
steps of a house, half the building was blown up, and he
was not even touched!</p>

<p class='c013'>You will often hear contemptuous allusions to
“amateurs” and their doings. But amateurs have
proved, especially in this war, that they often are just as
good as those who have been carefully trained to do a
special job.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the finest “amateur” corps in this war was
that of the British Volunteer Despatch-riders. Thanks
to their work the generals commanding were able to keep
in constant touch with one another, a matter of vital
importance in warfare.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of these young fellows were just fresh from their
Universities, and had no previous military experience, but
they showed remarkable dash and bravery while travelling
on motor-cycles through a country infested with enemies.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Many and thrilling were their adventures. On one
occasion an Australian from Cambridge, while speeding
along a country road, suddenly came upon a party of fourteen
German cavalrymen. With characteristic audacity
he drew his revolver and shot down an officer and one man,
whereupon the others ran away. Thus the Australian
was able to deliver his despatch, which informed a
corps commander that Germans were in the neighbourhood,
and so prevented what might have been a disagreeable
surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spy service, or, as they prefer to call it, the Secret
Intelligence Department, has always been very cleverly
conducted by the German War Office. Of the many
devices resorted to by the enemy to convey secret
information to those whom it concerned, the most
curious and original was that known as the sign of the
Black Cow.</p>

<p class='c011'>All over the area of war the French and British troops
were much surprised and mystified by seeing rough
sketches of a black cow on walls and the sides of houses,
even on gates and fences. Sometimes it was a small cow,
sometimes a large cow; sometimes the cow was standing,
sometimes she was lying down.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>At last a French officer, cleverer or blessed with more
imagination than his fellows, suddenly “tumbled to” the
explanation. The small cow meant that the road in front
was weakly defended. The large cow conveyed the warning
that the enemy were strongly entrenched near by.
Always the direction in which the head pointed told
where the enemy lay. Only when the head was tossed
back, and the horns were long and pointed, did it indicate
to the enemy that an aeroplane reconnaissance would be
valuable over there.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think one of the stories of plain-man valour which
impressed me most was that of a young telegraphist at
Lille. He managed to move his instruments into the
cellar of the house next to the Post Office. He then went
and installed himself there; and for three weeks, helped
by a few faithful friends who managed to give him food
and water at certain long intervals, he conveyed valuable
information to the Allied forces.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now one of the most extraordinary features of this war
has been the way in which towns and villages, aye, and
even houses, have been taken and retaken alternately by
friends and enemies. When the French had a temporary
success the young telegraphist did not come out, as most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>people would have done; he remained where he was,
knowing how probable was the presence of spies. Thus,
when Lille was once more in German occupation, he was
able to go on with his valuable help to the Allies.</p>

<p class='c013'>A good many of us just now are anxious about some
prisoner of war, and it is curious how few people know
the pains, penalties, and privileges to which the prisoner
of war is doomed or entitled. To begin with, the person
of a prisoner of war is sacred, and on the whole he is well
treated. Thus his captors have not the right to ask him
for information which would do harm to his own side.
He can, however, be forced to work for his captors. The
Germans are said to make their prisoners work at digging
trenches and making earthworks, which is not fair, for of
course such defences are intended to be used against the
prisoner’s own side. If a prisoner of war gives his word
not to escape he is often allowed much more liberty, but,
as a rule, British and French officers refuse to give any
such promise. Should one of them escape, he may be
fired at, but if he is retaken he may not be punished for
having tried to escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this war, Britain has treated her prisoners in a very
generous and humane fashion. Those among them who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>are wounded were actually visited by our King and Queen,
who spoke to them kindly in their own language, and gave
orders that their comfort should be studied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Immediately after what I have called the Battle of
the Dykes, came one of the fiercest struggles of the war,
that which centred round the curiously-named town of
Ypres. This quaint, beautiful, old town was once,
strange to say, besieged by an English Churchman, Henry
Spencer, Bishop of Norwich. He failed to take Ypres
because of the stout resistance offered to his soldiers
by a hedge of thorn-bushes! This hedge grew on
the ramparts, and proved a very real defence. In
memory of their preservation the people of Ypres hold
a fair every August, and in the Cathedral is a fine
painting called “Our Lady of the Garden,” to show
that the aid of Heaven as well as of the thorns had
been invoked.</p>

<p class='c013'>One wonders if the Kaiser had heard of that old siege,
when he issued his cruel and wanton order commanding
that Ypres, with its lovely old houses, and its famous
Cloth Hall, should be razed to the ground. Such destruction
could bring no military advantage. In fact, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>British held on to Ypres with splendid tenacity, though
many gallant and noble young lives were laid down during
the fierce fighting which went on there.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other cities, not less beautiful than Ypres, and not
less famed in history, were the scene of awful battles
during this phase of the great war.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tournai, where an important engagement was fought,
is a quiet, placid town where are made what are called
“Brussels” carpets. According to tradition, the art of
weaving these carpets was brought home from the Crusades
by Flemish soldiers, who had learnt it from the
Saracens. Tournai is quite used to being the scene of
fierce and bloody conflicts. It was splendidly defended
nearly five hundred years ago by a woman, Princess Christine
d’Espinoy, an ancestor of the Comte de Lalaing who
is now Belgian Minister in England. It was said of
this princess that she united the skill of a prudent general
to the valour of a brave warrior, and, although she was
herself badly wounded, she only gave in when three-fourths
of her garrison were either dead or unable to fight.
You may be interested to learn that Tournai is not far
from the famous battlefield of Fontenoy, where English,
Dutch, and Austrians were defeated by the French with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the help of the gallant Irish Brigades which had been
raised by, and for, the Stuarts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then there is the town of Courtrai, where was fought
the beautifully-named battle of the Golden Spurs. This
must not be confused with the Battle of the Spurs which
was fought two hundred years earlier. The Battle of
the Golden Spurs was won by the weavers of Ghent and
Bruges, fighting against the French. Hundreds of gilt spurs
worn by the French officers were gathered on the field
where British and French have now fought side by side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Round Peronne, too, fierce fighting went on during
the struggle in Northern France and Flanders. This
town has had the honour of holding more than one king
captive. King Charles the Simple was imprisoned there
for fifteen years, and is even said to have been starved
to death there. When Louis XI came to Peronne to
meet Charles the Bold, the latter shut him up for two
days in his castle to punish him for having stirred up
Liège to rebel, and only released him when Louis consented
to sign the Treaty of Peronne. The town was once
finely defended by a woman, Catharine de Poix, five
hundred years ago, and the fortress never fell till the Duke
of Wellington took it in 1815.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>I suppose there has never been before so long a battleline
as that which extended from the sea at Ostend right
across Flanders and through Northern and Eastern France
to the borders of Switzerland. The armies of the Allies
were under the supreme command of General Joffre,
whom Lord Kitchener described at the Guildhall banquet
as not only a great soldier but a great man. Sir
John French and the British Army fought mostly in
Flanders, where they repulsed terrific onslaughts delivered
by the flower of the enemy, notably by the famous
Prussian Corps of the Guards.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to recall that among the British and
French who thus fought side by side were descendants
of heroes who had fought against one another on the
field of Waterloo. For instance, a great grandson of
the Duke of Wellington was, through his work in the
Flying Corps, brought into daily touch with the Duke
of Elchingen, a direct descendant of Marshal Ney.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the fighting grew fiercer, so the number of the
wounded rose to terrible proportions. Splendid deeds
of valour were performed by the men and women, doctors,
nurses, and ambulance men, whose duty it is to bring in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and care for the soldiers who have fallen on the battlefield.</p>

<p class='c013'>I must tell you of one truly heroic deed done by an
English officer:</p>

<p class='c011'>After an engagement in which the Germans were
repulsed, they fell back, taking with them all their wounded
except one, who was overlooked. An English officer, having
given the order “Cease fire,” himself went out into the
open to pick up the wounded German. He was struck
by several German bullets and badly wounded, but the
Germans, as soon as they saw what his object was,
also ordered the “Cease fire.” Thereupon our officer
staggered to the fallen man and carried him to the German
lines. A German officer received him with a salute, and,
calling for cheers, pinned upon his breast an Iron Cross.
Then the officer returned to his own trenches. He was
recommended for the Victoria Cross for this notable
example of chivalry, but he died of his wounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The German soldier is sometimes a more gallant foe
than is his commander. A couple of wounded Germans
arrived at the hospital of Saint Mandier, Toulon, bearing
round their necks cards on which had been written by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>senior surgeon who had sent them there, the words:
“These two Germans are recommended to the special
care and attention of my colleagues, because they have
saved a French officer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It then appeared that on the field of battle these
Germans lay by the side of a French officer, who, like
themselves, was badly wounded. Presently there came
along a party of German cavalry, who, seeing the
Frenchman, proposed in a mean and cowardly way
to finish him off. But the two Germans—believed
to be Bavarians—would have none of it, and themselves
defended the wounded Frenchman. When all
three reached hospital, the French officer told the
story.</p>

<p class='c013'>While our men were fighting and dying for their country
in Flanders, people at home did all they could to help them.
No one was too great, no one too humble, to support
the many kindly and ingenious schemes which were
devised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Roberts, by a personal appeal, obtained thousands
of field-glasses for the use of our officers, and then,
with like success, he obtained great numbers of saddles
for our cavalry. To each donor, whether of the field-glasses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>or of the saddles, he sent a personal letter of
thanks.</p>

<p class='c013'>You know, of course, that Lord Roberts died as he
would have wished to die—with the Army. It was about
the middle of November that he went to France to see
and speak with the Indian troops, and there he caught a
chill which, alas! he had not strength to resist.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would take a great book to tell you all that Lord
Roberts tried to do, and all that he succeeded in doing,
for his country. I can only here give you the splendid
and heartening message which he sent to the children of
the Empire:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have all heard of the war; you have all heard
of the fighting forces sent from every part of the Empire
to help the Mother Country. Why are we fighting?
Because the British Empire does not break its promises,
nor will it allow small nations to be bullied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, the British Government promised, with all
the Great Powers of Europe, including Germany, that
no army should set foot on the territory of the little
nation of Belgium without her leave; in other words,
she ‘guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Germany, however, was bent on war, and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>dominating other nations. Britain did her best to keep
the peace, but Germany (breaking her word) marched
her armies into Belgium to try and conquer France.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Children of the Empire, this is why we are at war—to
hold our promise, to help our friends, and to keep the
Flag of Liberty flying, not only over our own Empire,
but over the whole world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God Save our King and Empire.</p>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Roberts</span> (Field-Marshal).”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Truly to Lord Roberts may be applied the famous
lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Great in council and great in war,</div>
      <div class='line'>Foremost captain of his time,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as the greatest only are,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his simplicity sublime.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>You will remember my telling you of the exploits of
the German cruiser Emden. Well, early in November
she was caught and destroyed by the cruiser Sydney, of
the Australian Navy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain of the Emden, whose name is Karl von
Müller, became a sort of hero of romance. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>partly because of his extraordinary ingenuity and daring,
partly because he treated the crews of the liners he captured
with humanity and politeness. Our seamen chivalrously
gave him and his officers all the honours of war, allowing
them to keep their swords.</p>

<p class='c011'>Von Müller was accused by the crew of at least one
of his captures of having sent out S.O.S. signals to lure
merchant ships into his net. These signals, as you know,
mean, “I am in great distress. Come as quick as you
can to the rescue.” If he really played this trick, I find
it difficult to admire him for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not know whether Captain von Müller is a reader
of Mr. Cutcliffe Hyne’s entertaining books, but he certainly
repeated in real life an exploit of Commander M‘Turk
in “The Western Ocean Pirate.” He added a sham
funnel to the Emden, and crept into Penang Harbour,
pretending to be a British cruiser. He was thus able to
dispose of two warships, one of them Russian.</p>

<p class='c013'>As winter drew near, everyone turned their thoughts
to providing warm garments and warming comforts for
the troops. The Queen appealed to the women of the
Empire and splendidly they responded. Young and old
fingers knitted socks, mittens, comforters, and body belts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>till hundreds of thousands were despatched to the front
and to the Fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Always remember that a deed of real kindness warms
the heart as truly as a cosy garment warms the body.
Our brave men, as we know by their grateful letters home,
felt ever so much heartened by these and other signs of
our gratitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while we were all working here, French women,
Russian women, and German women, helped by their
children, were also all intent on providing their soldiers
with winter comforts. But thinking of those industrious,
devoted German mothers and wives, I wonder if they ever
give a thought to those Belgian women who, homeless
wanderers owing to Germany’s ruthless inhumanity, can
provide nothing for <em>their</em> sons and brothers, but have
to rely entirely on the kindness of their Allies and of
America.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not think I can end this record of gallant, merciful,
and kindly deeds without telling you of the Santa Claus
ship from America.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor little Belgians, and those French boys and
girls whose homes have been destroyed by fire, shell,
and shot, are not likely to have any Christmas presents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>this year. Neither are the children of the other combatant
nations likely to have a very happy Christmas. So
a kind American editor bethought himself that here was
a chance for the boys and girls of America. The American
Government entered very heartily into the project of sending
what is now known as the Santa Claus ship to Europe
with Christmas presents for the children of the warring
nations, and they offered the use of a United States battleship.
It was settled that the battleship should fly at her
foremast a large white flag, with a red Star of Hope in
the centre, and under it the word “Inasmuch.” It was
further arranged that the Santa Claus ship should proceed
first to England, then to France, and then to Belgium, the
German children’s presents being sent through Rotterdam.</p>

<p class='c013'>I want you to try and make a special effort to remember
the following deed of heroism, because it seems to me to
be in some ways the most moving and splendid told you
in this book. That is why I have put it last.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was during an engagement near Nancy that Corporal
Lancaster, of the Coldstream Guards, was shot in the neck.
It was a terrible wound, and his comrades dragged him
into the shelter of a haystack. “Be quiet,” they whispered,
“for if you groan you will give away the position.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Lancaster remained silent for six hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the Germans advanced. At a hundred yards
from the haystack they were met by the blinding hail of
the machine-gun section of the Coldstreams, and the silence
of Corporal Lancaster was rewarded. Still grimly silent,
he was gathered in by the Red Cross men at the end of a
terrible day, and was soon on his way to England, who,
we may safely assert, has never borne a braver son.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the War Christmas drew in sight, kind Princess
Mary suddenly bethought herself how nice it would be
to send each of our sailors and soldiers a Christmas gift,
or rather a Christmas parcel. Her Royal Highness accordingly
issued a touching appeal to the public. It was responded
to with great eagerness and enthusiasm. As a
result five articles were sent to each man on active service,
from Sir John French and Sir John Jellicoe to the
youngest private or sailor serving under him. Every
parcel contained some tobacco in a brass box on
which was engraved, in a medallion, the names of the
Allies, the proud words “Imperium Britannicum,” and
a portrait of Princess Mary.</p>

<p class='c011'>I feel I cannot end a record of gallant and merciful
deeds more suitably than with the beautiful supplication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>for peace written by a French prince, Charles of Orleans,
when a prisoner in England five hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have not attempted to find or to provide a translation,
for this poem, written in what a boy poet once called
stained-glass-window French, is perfect, full of the humble
piety and unquestioning faith of an age more trusting and
holier than ours.</p>
